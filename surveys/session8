1133^NR^O^activity8^I was waiting for the bus and there weren\'t very many lights on, but the few that were there were brightly showing off the rapid descent of snowflakes. I stood there watching the snow as it hit the ground or people\'s jackets or car windows. It was really interesting to watch and see how in a matter of seconds the snow on my jacket had melted away. Funny how it was cold and there was snow on the ground, yet it was warm enough for the snow around me to melt and turn into puddles. That part was made evident as there were huge brown puddles all around me, trying not to get splashed by a car. As much as I do not enjoy winter and the cold it truly was a wonderful moment to be able to just watch such a simple thing like snow. Looking up into the air at it it looked so beautiful, all the many little snowflakes falling to the ground. I appreciated that moment and the beauty of it.

1130^CC^O^activity8^Well I just woke up at 10:00 and it is not 10:45 so not much has happened. I am worried becuase I have been sleeping for 10-11 hours per night. So this is bothering me. I normally wake up at 8:00.     So i got up, to the sound of my buzzer, it was the post man with a parcel for me. A purse that I had bought on e-bay for a christmas gift. It was nice, but not what I had expected, maybe I will keep it.     I then had my glass of Greens Plus, which looks gross, and use to tastw gross, but after 3 years of drinking it is fine. I then made tea, it is good tea, but not the loose tea from teaopea that I really like.     After this I sat down to my desk, turned on my computer and read my e-mails, and came to this site to do my survay. So that has been my exciting morning.     I am not sure what my deepest feeling are this morning, maybe anxiety over upcoming exams which is clouding my mind from other emotions.     Sorry that I have not done more this morning to describe my feeleing about.

I was feeling very happy as I am on vacation from work. Its fun to watch my dog playing in the yard. There was also some birds and of course plants and trees outside. I could never live anywhere without nature close by.  I always feel at peace outside.

1116^CC^O^activity8^I got home about an hour ago.  When I got home I put my stuff away and then felt like I needed something to eat. I went to the kitchen and made some eggs and toast. I was pretty content at the time I was making them knowing that they would be delicious and eaten within a few minutes. After I made my eggs I cleaned up and went to my room and surfed the net while I ate them. After I was done eating them, I felt pretty content with my meal and then realized it was time to get down to homework. This was sort of a buzz kill overall. I knew that I had a lot to do today and the thought of all the work kind of made me a little uneasy, but nonetheless I started to work through some homework before taking a break. This break that I\'m currently on makes me a little bit more happier than when I\'m doing homework. The thought of homework makes me a little stressed out and uneasy, I\'d rather be relaxing watching T.V or hanging out with friends, but I guess the faster I get this work done, the faster I can do the things that make me a little more happier.

1122^CC^O^activity8^Today I spent a considerable amount of time in the library in which i studied for an exam. I took breaks and my thoughts tended to wonder aimlessly. I started to feel tired and then went to the coffee shop to get some coffee. The noise in the coffee shop and the colour greatly contrasted that of the library. It brought up my spirits and I went back to my residence room and began to study some more. The window beside my desk showed a somewhat of a dreary day, which made me not want to step outside. I noticed my room had some dirty dishes on the desk, so I began to clean my room and put on some music. I found myself thinking about how sluggish I was feeling due to the fact I ate a big meal the night before, so I made a mental note to go to the gym. I also started thinking about how I need the environment around me to be clean inorder to be productive. This made me wonder whether I have OCD or if I\'m just an organized person.     At the gym, I noticed there weren\'t many people there, which was favorable. I went to the track and focused on the music I was listening to and jogged around the track. I occasionally looked over at the center field as there was a soccer game going on. Briefly thought that it would be nice to be on a team, but than reminded myself that I have no inclination towards sports.     In bed, I felt relaxed as my room was clean and tidy. I closed my eyes and did some breathing exercises and began to drift into a deep sleep.

1144^CC^O^activity8^I worked a six-hour shift today.  I work in a coffee shop, so there is always movement and activity.  The smell of coffee was obviously everywhere I went.  I worked with some of my favourite coworkers, so my shift seemed to go by quickly.  The customers seemed very timid today, maybe because we (the staff) were so loud and obnoxious with each other.  I liked being behind the counter because of how bright it was; it was pretty cloudy out the window, so I felt very comfortable.    I had some good conversations about life and new experiences with one of my coworkers.  She\'s only a year older than I, but she seems at least 10 years older.  Although I don\'t like to share my inner fears with people, she\'s very accommodating and welcoming, so it was kind of nice to be able to do that.

1381^NR^O^activity8^I really enjoy watching snow fall.  Although this time is usually dreary, the first snow falls always bring a sense of calm to me.  I\'m not sure if it\'s the gentle cascading of the snowflakes, or the quietness of the snow blanketing my surroundins.  As a child I would sit by the window and watch the snow all the time.  I remember being aware of the size of the flakes and noticed how that changed. Large flaked gathered up quickly, but the snowfall never lasted long.  Smaller snow flakes would take forver to accumulate, but the snow would  last for hours.  I can also remember how much fun it was to go outside and play in the snow while it was still falling.  I always felt a sense of joy and peace running through me, and I still look for that today.

1377^NR^O^activity8^It is early morning and I am looking outside the front window.  The sun is soft and the sky is growing bluer by the minute.  The branches of the birch tree hang in solemn spendour and the tips of the finer twigs glisten with moisture.  Concorde grapes hang from the vine against the brick wall and there are a few red berries on the euonymous alatus.  Light reflects off the white snow.  The picture is one of spare winter beauty and calm. I feel tranquil and alert as I get ready to complete this morning my last university assignment for the term.  By the end of the morning, I will only have two exams to prepare for.  I am grateful to see the end of this semester and to have sufficient time to prepare for a family Christmas I am greatly looking forward to.

1183^NR^O^activity8^well, it\'s kind of early and i\'m just sitting in bed with my partner, having a coffee and watching the sun come up over the field beside the house. It\'s a bright beautiful day with blue shadows from the trees stretching out across the field and the lilacs haven\'t quite shed their heavy snow so they\'re bent down over the garlic beds and the oldframe...i spent awhile yesterday going around and deadheading back the spent flowers that i could now reach because of the snow load...i\'ll write about yesterday because i haven\'t been outside yet today...  the first trip is up about 6;30 to let the dog out , rake down the ashes, take them out to the barrel , throw in some kindling and sticks and build up the fire, thenput on the kettle and make a coffee to take up and drink with Cindy while the fire gets going. We decide that she\'ll make breakfast while i get some schoolwork done and then I\'ll do the chores so she can get some time before she goes to work and keep that awful cold indoors...it\'s kind of grey and raw outside today.  When i go out to the barn the dog does his regular barging ahead to check everything out. This used to annoy me till one day he got the skunk spray instead of me so now i just think it\'s his nature and he does it out of something like love actually (or protection or whatever)...  the lambs and ewes on the feeder side come running out to the feed troughs as i come close to the barn and wait impatiently as i drag the stocktank heater from the other tank and run them water and shovel the snow from their feedpans and finally give them their grain...there\'s six or seven that are ready and i strt thinking about when i\'m going to find the time to phone the customers and get the orders together and ship them and the slaughterhouse is probably closed for christmas and Lars and Maria are getting a bit impatient for their lamb...oh well...bcak to to other side to feed the ewes and rams and drag the hose over and water them and then climb into the lower mow and fill the mangers, then up to the upper mow to fill the big mangers and then the highlight is the climb over into the logbarn mow to fill the lamb manger. I always stop and sit for a second on the sill log and look down over the feed floor with the lambs milling about below...there\'s something extremely right and beautiful and peaceful about the view from this spot...plus i\'m a little puffed from all the clambering about and busting bales and shit...then down and drain the hose and close up the gates and back to the house, always remembering to shut off the pump on the way...the feeling is satisfaction , especially as i hear people in earnest conversations about good food and organics and wanting to plant a garden...i really do live in paradise

1432^CC^O^activity8^I sat down on my couch when I first came down this morning. I didn\'t read, or turn on the T.V., instead I just looked outside and watched the sun come up. I love watching the sun rise. Especially now that there is snow on the ground. It looked cold outside compared to my warm, soft couch. I changed my position into recline and leaned back, sitting in the sun for the next 20 minutes. It warmed the dark brown material of my couch, and I was so comforatble I almost fell back asleep. I tried to let my mind go blank, not to worry about school, exams, money, christmas, reference letters or anything. I just wanted to enjoy some quiet time by myself before I got up top really start the day.

1123^NR^O^activity8^I woke up to my alarm clock going off, and I immediately deactivated it. I wanted desperately to go back to sleep, but I kept my eyes open, I\'m not really sure why. Probably because the sunlight coming in through the curtain and its opening was so bright. I don\'t think I\'d seen the sun like that for a week. I just lay on my side, looking at the window for a few moments, I\'m not really sure how long it really was. Looking at the dust floating in our stagnant air inside. I was thinking about how cold and fresh and \"thin\" the air was.\"Thin\" being an expression I used as a kid to define the purity of outdoor air, like the opposite of humid, indoor, or \"thick\" air I guess. I just stayed this way for a while, and the mini-experience, this weird interaction almost, with nature made me think of a song, by Sufjan Stevens. It\'s called \"The Predatory Wasps of The Palisades is Out to Get Us!\". When I listen to that song, I just imagine winter mornings, and sunlight strewn across carpeted floors, simple beauty everywhere. Stevens\'s music has that effect on his listeners. It just reminds me of being a kid, of noticing things like that, like when flies get caught in between windows. I still notice that, but I tell fewer people.

My mom was about to leave to go get groceries and asked me if i wanted anything. I said Grapefruit and carrots. After she left i flipped on some MTV, and watched the hills for a bit. After that i went to the kitchen and made myself some breakfast. and egg and an english muffin. After that i ate it while watching a thankgiving special of paris hiltons my new BFF. It surprises me how many people tried out for that show...but it is none the less very entertainging. I then decided that i should start working on my essay for philosophy, as it is due quite soon, and now i am here.

I watch the neighbourhood kids play and sigh to myself saying how I wish I could be carefree like them. However, life for people at age eighteen is never easy as we all must carry some load of responbitity for not only ourselves, but for the world around us as well.

1208^CC^O^activity8^i havent done much today.  i woke up in my bed, feeling very tired.  i walked into our very unclean bathroom, took a shower, and made my way to breakfast.  the cafe is one of the last places in the world i would like to eat.  i feel like i am so sick of the cafeteria food and just the cafe itself.  my experiences in the cafe are never good.  today specifically, my eggs were gross and barely cooked, and some of the workers are extremely rude.  its their job to be there and are getting paid, so if they hate it so much why are they working there? anyways, the coffee was cheap and gross as well and my pancakes were severely uncooked.  overall when i left the cafe i felt completing unsatisfied

1198^CC^O^activity8^Today I spent time cooking in the kitchen in the morning. I took my time and made a nice brunch for myself since I had slept in (which was awesome). After having brunch I did the dishes and cleaned the kitchen (counters, sweaaping, table). Once it was neat and clean I took out the garbage. It felt nice to take my time to get these things done since I have nothing else to do today except read and study for my exams. After that I spent a lot of time on the couch catching up with old friends and keeping up-to-date with what is going on in the world. Then I noticed the Happiness Survey Reminder and am working on that!

1430^CC^O^activity8^Today i woke up and immedietly felt nervous because i had told my self i was going to work on my essay all day today. The essay is due in 2 days, and i havn\'t started so i was feeling anxious about getting it done well. At first i was sitting on my bed and i felt uncomfortable so i moved to my desk, and moved a comfy chair to my desk to prepare for a long day. I have done some of my essay and am feeling a bit more relieved, but a little uneasy about whether it is done correctly. I left my room once to go get a sub and found myself thinking about the essay alot. I have jittered with my fan alot, i felt really hot, but cold at the same time. I was irritated earlier with people inmy room talking while i was trying to work on the essay.

1369^NR^O^activity8^I did\'nt do much today except for stay in and watch a comedy movie. I woke up pretty late and I only woke up because this annoying beam of light was hitting me directly into the eyes. I can tell what the weather is like by looking outside my window, just an hour ago it was nice and bright and looking out right now it looks dull and gloomy. This kind of weather makes me sad a depressed. The movie cheered me up a little. Living alone is not the best thing you could ask for. I thought it was going to be great, my own stuff, room, freedom, but no! I miss my parents and with the weather like this I wish I was home with them making tea and eating together like a happy family.

1399^NR^O^activity8^Today I spent the day driving home from my sisters who lives 4 hours away. While driving I noticed that in different areas, there was different amounts of snow on the ground. The trees were all bare from their leaves and stood naked in the wind. Their were many crows and other black birds swooping down on the road, in through the trees, looking for something to eat.  The sun was in and out of the clouds today, but for the most part the day was very dull. I felt tired and anxious, wanting to get home faster than I was.

1190^CC^O^activity8^I spent most of my day today at work. I work in a retail store, but in an office in the back. I spent the majority of the day sitting at my desk working on reports and processing returns that are being sent back to the vendors. I also spent a lot of my day walking back and forth between two offices (after I finalize the reports, I have to go pick up the print outs in the office next door). I spent about an hour of my day sending out faxes, where in between faxes I sat and relaxed in the chair in the office. The only times I had to go out onto the sales floor was when I was going outside for my breaks for a cigarette. I was thinking about how busy the store was and how glad I am that i work in the back office and dont have to deal with crazy customers! I thought the day dragged by because I finished most of my work within the first two hours of my shift so it was hard to find things to do to take up the rest of the time I had to be at work.

1380^CC^O^activity8^I woke up next to my boyfriend this morning and we stayed in bed for 2 hrs talking. We actually spend a lot of time sleeping more than anything else. We also spend a lot of time together; the only time we\'re apart is when one of us has classes or has work to do(like right now!). Anyway, I remember feeling completely comfortable on the single bed. The blanket was really warm, and the pillows were REALLY comfortable. I also remember thinking that I could get used to waking up next to him every morning and the first thing I\'d do everyday would be kissing him.

It was obvious while I was walking that the once recent snow fall had turned to ice and was creating icecicles on some houses.  Tree\'s have no leaves on them, and it seems that all the leaves have up and left.  There is no real sign of wild life because winter is well on its way.  You can just hear the hussling and bussling of individuals trying to get to and from places..

His life seems very simple compared to mine and I try to understand if that\'s just my perception, or a fact.

I think sometimes animals understand the key to a happy life better than we do as humans.

1439^NR^O^activity8^Today as i was in the house and i decided to take a look outside. I went to the window in the living room, its as tall as me and very wide. I just stared out the window for a while looking at the fallen snow on the ground. It reminded me of this time last year when i was in residence. I had no concerns about anything, just a few silly first year exams. I was so carefree. Then i remembered highschool days and the random times waiting for the bus in the freezing cold, or how i fell in snow banks all the time. I felt really happy looking outside. Wondering what else was out there that i had not yet seen in my life. I was feeling very stressed before i looked outside. It just made me feel like there was more to life and to stay happy and not worry about the small things. I saw a few squirrels making their last rounds of collecting all their food for the winter. All in all i felt very free. That even though i was sheltered inside, i still knew that there was more out there for me when i need it.

Large south facing picture window letting in loads of light and subsequently making me feel energized and able to focus on my task. Picked up the paper from the front porch that morning... Crisp, refreshing winter day. Closed the door, shut out the cold, dropped the damp paper to the floor. Laundry on the go, can hear the water being pumped into the machine and draining. Always reminds me of a waterfall and the smell in the air is \'clean\' scented. I feel content, rejuvenated, inspired. These emotions make me motivated to start and finish other things, targeting my burst of energy and putting it to good use. Also hopeful that when it comes time to go to bed, that my body and mind will be positively spent from the day\'s activities and that I\'ll be able to channel the same energy into a deep, restful sleep.

The winter weather is calm when then sky is clear and then snow is falling gently or not at all. The sky is more white with clouds with the sun shinning through every once in a while. The snow is resting on the roof tops and there are snowmen on the neighbours lawns. Kids are outside enjoying the winter weather.

1298^CC^O^activity8^i went to coffee indoors with a friend today and it was really fun.  i had not seen her for at least 1 year so it was nice to have the ability to catch up.  I did keep thinking about how funny it is that we have grown apart but can still talk normally.  we have both evolved and grown through the past year or so and it was interesting to see that.  being inside i was able to ponder this with little distractions except our conversations and that of otheres in the coffee shop.  i also spent some time at my desk working on my last essay for school, making me feel frustrated and wishing I was anywhere but inside at my desk writing this final essay.  sometimes i feel like im not going to get all of my work finished which is really difficult because it gets so stressful wondering if I will or not.  I am not sure how to handle all of that stress sometimes and it gets annoying sitting at a computer writing essay after essay relentlessly. I do enjoy spending time inside but doing more relaxing and enjoyable things.  I find when i am relaxing inside its nice but when i am inside not relaxing all i want to do is to go outside.  being inside did not really release any deep emotions or thoughts in me today however, apart from stress uring the essay and happiness and curiosity while having coffee with an old friend.

1319^NR^O^activity8^I notice outside that the weather looks like it is nice. I\'m sure it\'s quite cold out, but the sun is shining and looks so inviting. It makes me want to go outside and play. The sky is very blue, with hints of grey from the clouds. I see fluffs of white cloud passing through the sky. They move because the wind is blowing them around. I see the tops of the trees. Sometimes I see a bird sit on top of the branches and they call out. When the sun is out, everything looks very bright and I feel happy, and content. It calms me, and I feel more relaxed. I don\'t like the cold, but I like seeing big, fluffy flakes of snow fall from the sky. Seeing them fall makes me feel happy, and warm despite the cold. I enjoy the simple pleasure  of watching them. The flakes are so dainty and beautiful. I just like to watch them fall.

I spent maybe 10 minutes with my dogs, and other than that, the only encounter with nature today will be watching the weather cause of the storm that is suppose to hit tonight.

1325^NR^O^activity8^This morning, I drove two friends home who stayed over after formal last night.  I was blinded by the light of the sun peeking through the clouds, but it kept disappearing.  Driving with glaring sun made me slightly frustrated because I had a headache.  But at the same time it made me sad.  I\'ve been really sad a lot lately, and really homesick.  Much like the sun, I\'ve been having small spots of joy where I get to shine.  But for the most part, I\'m been boxed up and cold.  I don\'t know why I\'m sad.  I guess I\'m just lonely.  I can only imagine that if the sun was an animate being, that it would also feel pretty damn lonely.  I mean, this year, I\'m farther away from my friends, school is harder, and I am single.  It\'s a lot of big changes all at once.  And the fact that I don\'t turn 19 until April, and the rest of my friends are already 19 and 20, I feel isolated that much more.  But I\'m sure things will get better eventually.  Not everyday can be cloudy?

1275^NR^O^activity8^Last night, i was taking a walk through a neighborhood whilst i was drinking. ALong the way I met a lovely patch of ice that tripped me causing me to fall on my head and get a concusion. There is lots of snow outside and it is just beautiful. Coming from toronto, snow is mostly slushy anddirty, but here it is clean and white.

1146^CC^O^activity8^I spend my time studing for the fianls tat are coming up next week and the week after. I try to focus as much as I can, and not get distratic with the computer and the tv. I also wash the dishes in the kitchen, but the sound of the frige really annoys me. I fold the clothes from the dryer when I am taking a break of studying and I hang out with my brother in the living room. While I am not studying, I watch one tree hill on the net.

I looked around and noticed that the sky is sort of grey and cloudy and it was fairly cold. the trees were all missing their leaves as winter is starting. There was the odd tuff of grass sticking out from the patches of snow.

1098^CC^O^activity8^ Today I spent alot of time in my boyfriend\'s bed, laying, watching tv, eating and relaxing. I often do this on sundays as it is the day I take to relax every week. I woke up at 1030 and did noty get out of bed until about 1:30. It was relaxing, and set the tone for the rest of my day

1209^NR^O^activity8^Today, I went outside for two different occasions. In the first time, it was pretty sunny and I could see the blue sky. Honestly speaking, I saw some animals around (despite the fact that it is pretty cold these days), and I thought that it was going to be a good day. And so I was.  However, after a while, I went to the Rideu Center and ended up having a little arguement with a friend of mine who went with me. And when I actually went out, after our arguement and shopping, I noticed that the weather got unusually cloudy like it was going to rain. I felt gloomy, or maybe it was the influence of the weather.  Now that I think about it, maybe the whole weather has some kind of impact on people and their emotions...

I embraced the crisp feeling of nature, It made wish i was home and i could go snow machining, or take a walk down the road with my dog. I also saw it snowing in the early morning today, which made think that things are going to be covered heavily with snow as Ottawa is suppose to get about 15 cm tonight.

Later I had coffee in the kitchen area and played board games with some friends. There was a lot of laughter and fun but some struggle for power was apparent. All day today I have been dreading a paper I have to write and the stress built up to a panic attack. I still can not breathe right and I feel light headed. I tried to nap to calm myself down but it didn\'t work. My heart is beating fast and my thoughts keep wandering. I feel anxious and I can\'t focus. I am also having problems in the social life, particularly with a love interest.

I looked through a lot of my old things and it brought back really amazing memories. I cleaned the house and felt a lot of anger towards to my roommates for always being so messy and leaving me with a mess to clean up every morning. I considered yelling at them but calmed down by cooking food and watching some more television.

I felt like I was just doing things robotically. The sound of cars and people were rampant. Every now and then I would go indoors to push in carts. When indoors the coldness suddenly disappeared and I began to feel warm. My mind cleared up and I could smell fresh bread. But as I walk outside again my mind closed off as I went back to pushing carts mindlessly.

I noticed the weather outside appeared to be a sunny but chilly day and was happy to be inside. Nect I went to the supermarket where I struggled around the crowds of people in the parking lot as well as once inside. It was cramped and the aisles were blocked woth people\'s carts which made it difficult to get by. I did spend time with my cat today and she helped to bring some calm to a day that was filled with a hectic pace and organized chaos.

There was a nice clear sky and then it snowed slightly for most of the trip. it was very calming and peaceful. I just felt at peace and I could just think about how beautiful it is around North Bay and on the way to Ottawa. I was feeling very happy and content the whole time as I enjoyed the gorgeous scenery. But I ended up feeling so at peace and calm that I fell asleep until I got to Ottawa.

I remember thinking my bed was way too comfortable to leave and there was no where else i would rather be or noone else i would rather be with at that time. Later on i had a shower and felt the pressure of the water on my face to be very soothing and made me feel happy. I then went to the cafeteria (I live on residence) and feeling very in tune with my self and my surroundings. I have been in my room ever since, trying to do my homework..but struggling because i keep thinking about my boyfriend.

1163^NR^O^activity8^When I woke up this morning, all three of my cats were sleeping in my bedroom. One was on my dresser, while the other two were at the foot of my bed.  I am always happy to see them, and to be near them. I think about how these little animals could be wild if never domesticated. I also think about how easy a life they have. They sleep most of the day. They play and eat when they want to. And they also get groomed and cuddled.   Most animals don\'t have it as easy as my cats do. The thought of animal cruelty really disturbs me.

1376^CC^O^activity8^for the most part, today i wrote an essay for my seminar. It took pretty much the entire day. during this time, i did a load of laundry and some dishes for a mental break. i sat on my couch with my dogs beside me. i am not pleased with the essay i wrote, nor with the amount of house work i did today.  I did not take my dogs for their usual walk, for i had to deliver the essay to school later in the night. I actually just recently got home. I also saw a couple of my friends on my adventure. that was nice - they bought me dinner. it was delicious. all i have to do now is have a shower, put the clothes in the dryer, and go to bed with my dogs by my side. i like sleep. im soo tired.

1378^CC^O^activity8^Waking up feeling so tried. Trying really hard to just wake up but couldnt.  Falling in and out of sleep until i put my ipod on to wake me up. After two songs I got up and started to make myself some waffels. They were wholewheat blueberry.  I like them but i hate it when the syurp makes them a bit soggy so I had to eat them fast. While i was eating them  i was watching T.V show Small people big world. I realize im really not a fan of the dad on that show and might have a slight crush on the average size son. Then I called my mom about a hotel.  It was a funny phone call because i was so distracted by looking at a page on the hotels website and making sure my reservation went through. I felt unsure and uneasy about the booking because the price is rediculusly cheap. So I called the hotel and made sure that everything was okay and it was so now im at ease. After that I sent a few texts to friends informing them about the situation.  Then I had a shower which was nice.  Then I got ready came online saw i had another survey to fill out and here I am filling it out.

1204^CC^O^activity8^Today, I studied for my psychology exam in my room, and I also surfed the internet for a while. I was happy that I got to stay in my room all day because it is where I feel most comfortable. I felt warm, safe and cozy because my room is the only place I can truly be alone. I later went to work at Loblaws, where I am a cashier. I felt completely different, I didn\'t feel at home (comfortable and safe) because it is a totally different environment. I do not really enjoy work, but I enjoy spending time in my room, so that may be one of the reasons why. There are too many rules at work (from what I can wear, to what I can do) where as at home, I don\'t have those stupid, pointless rules.

1223^NR^O^activity8^Today i went for a jog outside. i ran along the Redeau river and around Carleton campus. i didn\'t see many animals besides some geese flying south for the winter. They seem to be late this year.  Snow covers most of the ground ,although much of it is wet.  The trees are bare, and look old, with no plants or bushes left.  Winter seems depressing, however i enjoy it. i like snow. i also studied environmental science, beucase my exam is on firday! i learned about trophic levels and food chains. Top pedertors are at the top!

The feelings that I am feeling are nervousness as I want to do well on these exams but they are so close together I have had a hard time studying for them. I also have experienced excitement knowning that once I am done I get to go home for about a month.

The only form of relaxation I have at my desk, while studying, is the sounds of my music in the background. My deepest thoughts consist of the questioning whether I will be able to finish my essay in time, and if I will be prepared enough for my exam.

Other than that not to much. Unfortunately my mind is involved in other places so things are being ignored more than they should be.

My body was at eaze and comfortable, It was the best way to start the day .

1307^NR^O^activity8^this morning, shortly after waking up, which i did reluctantly, i noticed that the rose bush that i bought for my girlfriend was looking a little dry.  don\'t ask me why, but she has the habit of putting it in the bathroom, the only room in the house without a window to the outside.  so, guessing that the poor thing was starved for sunlight, i brought it into the bedroom and opened the curtains a little bit.  then i stood there looking at the flowers that were slowly emerging.  the rose is an interesting flower.  one of the most traditionally beautiful flowers that has a dual nature.  along with this world famous beauty it also has sharp thorns that hurt if you\'re not careful.  what other kind of plant has such a sharp contrast?  i wonder, what happened to the rose that made it have to grow thorns in order to protect itself.  being so beautiful has it\'s advantages and disadvantages it would seem.  then i noticed the sun, partially hidden behind some clouds.  i wondered if it was cold outside or not, and if i should dress for the occasion.  i guess it\'s always easier to take clothes off if you need to, but putting on something you don\'t have with you is the tricky part.  it\'s also been snowing on and off for the last few days and wondered if i should encounter another snow fall in the near future.  could be fun, could be a pain in the ass, pardon the expression.  life is always full of contrasts.

1428^CC^O^activity8^This morning when I went downstairs to have breakfast I laid down on the couch for a few minutes. Two of my friends from my home town are here to visit, so I was able to talk to them. I am a little worried about the situation since they will be staying for around a week, and this is the time I should be spending on exam preparation. It worries me that all of my exams are condensed into roughly one and a half weeks, I feel like I will be really stressed out. I am desperately looking forward to going home for Christmas, but I cant picture how good it will be without remembering what I will have to do before going there.

1361^NR^O^activity8^As I was studying for my exams I looked out my window. From where I was laying I can see all the bare trees framed by a grey sky. It looks quite drab and un-emotional. There is no movement in the trees and they sky is simply a blank pallet. It is kind of sad to look at as it appears to be sparce and desolate.  There is a movement at the corner of the window as a squirel moves along one part of the tree to the next. It is the only thing that I can see moving.   I wonder what it would be like to be free of exams and the strain that they cause. I imagine what it would be like to be up in the trees without many of the everyday life stresses that we experience. I also wonder what it would be like to sit up there and look down on everyone as they pass by. My primary concerns would be only the basics of nature, food, shelter and protection from predators.

I knew there were a million things that I should be doing.  Exam time always puts me in a constant state of hectic.  I\'m never exactly relaxed.    I tried to organize my life in the shower.  MUCH to my pleasure, I realized that it was WEDNESDAY today and not thursday!!!!! AMAZING!!!! A whole day gained, which is amazing, because I wasn\'t very productive yesterday.  I felt pretty invincible getting out of there.  My stress was cut in half.  I always worry that there is never enough time, and when there is enough time, I\'m worrying that I\'m not spending it right, and when I\'m busy thinking about that I\'m not thinking about what I should be thinking about which are the notes in front of me.    I took about 20 minutes today to write some stuff just for me, not for school, not for anything.    It felt so good, getting back in touch with myself.  Not thinking about everything going on around me, and just being me.  I started thinking about how rare that is these days.  Taking a couple of minutes a day to just be you, and do what you enjoy doing, and getting back in touch with inspiration.  Everything gets so routine.  I think I\'m gonna do it everyday.

I probably looked out the window three times.. each time shuddering slightly at the sight of the snow.. it\'s cold.. i hate winter. I then ran out to the car to go home and curl up on the couch to sleep. I hate hate hate winter.

I also felt quite determined at many points, as I was working quickly and efficiently. I was annoyed and stressed at having my out of work boyfriend just chilling on the couch smoking weed all day, but if anything i see it as a driving force for me (in the sense that my hard work will eventually maybe allow me a better job that will afford me my own place). I felt accomplished and proud when I finished studying for a class and was able to move on to the next. I sometimes feel while studying, as though it is a futile endeavor, and that if i don\'t know it already, i never will (as i have a terrible memory!!)But i push forward, as i am not a quitter, and come next week, exams will be over and i will be able to breathe and relax. And my boyfriend wasn\'t feeling well today either, and i felt guilty for not feeling bad for him, as i\'m so tired of feeling sorry for him. Does that make me a bad person? i don\'t think so...just a frustrated one!

1487^NR^O^activity8^It\'s the winter time, and a blanket of snow has covered the city. The air is cold, and nature is lifeless. Trees have lost their leaves, and squirrels are a rare sight. Despite all that I can\'t help but feel alive, the snow slowly falling to the ground is a sight to behold, and the calm it bring is almost comforting. It makes you appreciate having a home to return to.

1240^CC^O^activity8^When i came home from an 8 and a half hour shift at work, i went to my room and listened to my new CD that i got the day before. it was my first listen, so i tried to get very comfortable. i laid down in my best and turned off the lights, and listened to each song from the record. i thought about my day, and the exams to follow. after i began to stress, due to the exam, i decided to forget about it and just focus on listening to the music. the album was very good, and i listened to it another two times.

I also spent some time cleaning the store as well as folding laundry.  I spent some time watching Friends because I felt my head was going to explode if I did any more readings.  It was good to just sit on the couch and watch a funny sitcom because I have been really stressed out lately.  My thoughts were always trailing off towards thinking about when I finish my exams, what Im going to be doing with my break.  Hanging out with my friends who are coming back home, working in the mall, spending time with my family and doing all my christmas shopping.  I was very stressed out and nervous whenever I thought about how Im not quite ready for my exams yet, so I decided to just try and think past them to a better time of the holidays and my nineteeth birthday approaching.

1343^NR^O^activity8^I experienced the weather from inside today, watching the clouds and the weather through the windows. The air appeared crisp and cool, and barely moving, as the trees did not sway, but simply stood still in the frosty air. A thin layer of frost covered my entire backyard, covering the winter cover of the pool, the grass, the pavement and the shed. It gave off the feeling of relative calmness, as everything seemed to be at peace, even if it was in a frozen state.

1228^CC^O^activity8^Today, I spent all of my day indoors studying for upcoming exams.  I mainly stayed in my room. In my room I feel like once I get into a groove I am very productive. The subject I was working on allowed me to listen to music while I study, which was pleasant. I feel as if I don\'t read properly if I\'m listening to music, so I tend not to do that.   Once I get behind on my studying schedule I begin to feel overwhelmed, as if I won\'t be able to catch up. One thing that frustrates me is that my roommate never seems to do any work! It annoys me very much. All I ever see her doing is watching videos! She can\'t be that smart!!  I feel very accomplished with everything I have done today. But since I have started studying so much I feel like I am cutting myself off from my friends here at school. I wish I didn\'t have to study so much, but I\'m afraid of getting bad marks!   I start to feel lonely being in my room all the time. I especially feel like that when my roommate is not here and I\'m all alone in my room. I start to think about my boyfriend, and how much I miss him. I usually get distracted with that. We don\'t live in the same city while I go to school. It is hard, but we\'ve worked through it.   When I get distracted from working though, I REALLY get distracted. I get onto Youtube, and Facebook, and its a while before I realize I should actually be doing work. All I need to think about to get myself in line is how much work I will have to do tomorrow if I don\'t do my fair share today!  But studying all the time makes me worry about exams. Thinking about my marks so much also makes be think about the marks I will need to transfer to a different University next year. That is something that I will be worried about until I deal with it though.   Even though I think I look a little anti-social, I\'m glad that I have the reputation as a study bug, rather than a party animal. I would rather get good grades than party my head off and fail first year. I don\'t know if that is weird of me!

1438^CC^O^activity8^My first experience today was waking up out of bed. This experience was okay my bed was very warm and the rest of the room seemed to be a little bit colder when I did get out of bed I went on my computer and put some music on I wanted to listen to the song \"Bounce\" by Timbaland because I thought about it before I went to sleep. My deep feelings about this moment was that the people in the music video could dance very well and that I was not aware that Justin Timberlake and Dr. Dre were in the song, so overall it gave me a sense of accomplishment for meeting my goal of listening to the song. I spent most of the day in my room studying, studying sort of gave me a sense of accomplishment but a had the feeling that I was not studying enough, but only time will tell if this is true or not. While I was in my room someone invited me to a Sens game this made me excited but I was worried that I did not have enough cash but everything worked out and I went. So overall this day was nice I am not content because when you get content then you stop moving forward so I keep moving and never get content.

I stopped to bend down and pet the neighbors little dog who is often let out to run free in the area and felt her warm wet fur on my fingers.  She rolled over on her tummy to greet me and I gave her a few nice rubs and pats and was on my way back to my house.  I noticed the birds in the trees chirping to each other as a squirrel ran and scurried up a tree to tease them.  I felt at peace and refreshed being outside.  I cam back in to continue my morning and somehow wish that I was outside once again~

She\'s on one couch and i\'m on the other and she\'s watching some television. I\'m extremely tired and stressed today because i have my first exam tomorrow so most things that i am feeling and experiencing all surround my upcoming 6 exams in the next 10 days. My deepest feelings are really just that of hoping i do well and pass that one class right now that i\'m failing. I need to do well in order to be able to switch my program later on this year from an arts degree to a science degree and you need pretty good grades for that.

1277^NR^O^activity8^Today I walked outside to an appointment. It was only a few minutes but it was quite early in the morning and it felt really good to be outside. There were no cars on the road and it was pretty quiet. I hadn\'t been awake that early in nearly week so it was nice to be up at a different time and see a different part of the day then I had become accustomed to seeing. The fact that I was outside woke me up. The wind was blowing and although the sun wasn\'t shining it wasn\'t very cold outside. Since exams are coming up I\'m feeling very anxious and getting to just spend 5 minutes outside walking was also a nice change from being inside cramped up studying. It also made me feel jealous of the people who were able to be outside and enjoy it for all that it was worth, while i couldn\'t really do that because the thought of exams were lingering in the back of my head.

1217^NR^O^activity8^Today I am writing this journal around one o\'clock. I have just woken up at twelve so I haven\'t really had time to go outside yet or read an article of some kind. I have though looked out side my living room window which over looks Ottawa\'s experimental farm. There is a light layer of fluffy snow on top of the field that makes me just want to go run and jump, maybe roll around, but basically just have fun playing in the snow, and be free! I can tell it is a little bit windy out today as the leave-less trees are blowing back and forth. Snowflakes are lightly falling from the big, dull, grey clouds in the sky. There is no sun really today which makes me sad because I love the sun. I don\'t mind winter unless the sun is out, but if it is not then the cold hits harder because there is no warmth from the sky. It looks cold out today even though apparently it is plus three out. I can\'t believe it is winter already, December already, and that Christmas is in less than a month. I am not from Ottawa but I have been living here for basically the past three years. I was diagnosed with cancer in 2006 and have been getting treatment ever since from the wonderful childrens hospital here called CHEO. Then I actually did move here for school, so I am excited to go back home and see all my friends in family over the holidays. When you have cancer as a child you get a wish from The Childrens Wish Foundation, and I picked a trip to Hawaii! So after Christmas on Dec. 28th that is where I am going to escape from the cold, school, and my cancer for a little while. I am really excited to go there, I\'ve always wanted to. After two full years of hospital, chemotherapy, radiation, and surgeries, I finally get to have a break from it all and relax for once in paradise.

This involved watching lectures from my computer. I did this off and on all day long, never leaving my home. I didn\'t want to go outside, though I had planned to study in a local Starbucks. It was terribly windy and cold out and decided to stay in. My boyfriend visited around 5:00pm, stayed for an hourm went to his home to pick up some things and came back at 9:00pm. We are absolutely in love and whenever we talk it is still exciting and interesting. I am always elated when he is around, so having him sleep over was wonderful and being able to wake up to him is even better.

I haven\'t had the time to read leisurely nor have I left the house and have had no encounter with nature recently. My only experiences are what I perceive from the window. When I look outdoors I am often over come with a feeling of complete gloom. During day time it seems useless to turn on the lights inside but the light reflecting off the snow outside is minimal. I always ensure to draw the curtains away from the windows to allow as much light into our home as possible. It is grey and gloomy everyday. Once in a while the sun might peak through the clouds but this time of year the sun is too few and far between. The tree outside that hovers above our deck is now baren and appearing lifeless and our lawns and that of our neighbours are covered in a layer of snow. The breif moments I have taken to go outside involve bone chilling winds and nothing more pleasant then being indoors.

1386^CC^O^activity8^Today I mostly went out and did work for my sister. I bought everything she asked me to bring her, except for the perfume her friend wanted. I\'m panicking a little cause I have to pack for her and my dad and I still have to find so much for her in her jungle of a room before my dad\'s plane this tuesday, and I have work and exams and the house is a mess. But, ah well. After I got her the transcripts from uni I came home and, wasted time. I tried studying but for the life of me I could not concentrate. I think its cause I\'m overwhelmed, so I just want to put it off for as long as possible. Which, in hindsight (spelling)? really is a rather stupid plan considering I\'ll just be evern more stressed out and rushing the closer it gets to Tuesday. Anyways, I spent time mostly on my couch \"studying\" for my psyc exam, which I REALLY want to get an A on but I probably wont considering I ended up watching TV for most of the day while dad was out. OJ was sentenced to jail, YAY! I find Psyc very interesting, but I still couldn\'t force myself to concentrate. Maybe I have ADD? Wouldn\'t be surprised. lol I really should\'ve just cleaned......

1090^CC^O^activity8^Today, I did not engage in much.  I somewhat slept in, went for a drive and a coffee, picked up sandwiches for me and my partner, and studied.  However, much of this seems like a blur.  I am unwillingly focused on last night when I was out with my partner and many friends and co-workers.  I didn\'t feel comfortable in such a large group of people and felt ignored by my partner for a girl he was previously interested.  Furthermore, this morning, he received a message from an ex-girlfriend that wants to get together with him - in the message she also admitted she was drunk and would be too afraid to ask him otherwise.  Since they used to date, for 7 years, I suspect what her intentions are.  Therefore, going through my activities today, I was participating mindlessly as I feel a bit unworthy and unwanted.  Furthermore, knowing that I am not at my happiest, I feel like a fake today trying not to show my not-so-ideal mood.  I have resigned to the fact that I dont\' have much to offter the day of December 6th, and I\'m already ready for bed after only have been awake for 5 hours.

1338^CC^O^activity8^All I\'ve done today has been study at my house and sleep at my girlfriends house. At my house, I study in my room which is a comfy area in my house. It\'s pretty plain, just white walls and wooden floors, but it\'s one place that I can be alone concentrate on writing and studying. The only emotions I have felt there lately have been stress since it is in the middle of my exam weeks and my psychology exam is coming up soon! I\'ve been reading and practicing lots to do well on the exam, but the exams are so unexpected that studying just seems stressful. When I\'m in my room these feelings don\'t go away, but I can relax if I need to and take a break from studying. At my girlfriends house it is very much the same. I\'m in a comfortable, quiet room away from most people so I can relax or just watch TV without having to worry about the rest of the things going on in my life.

1435^NR^O^activity8^Today, I\'ve been studying at home all day. I\'ve been studying for exams and the most nature I\'ve encountered today would be my neighbourhood around me. It\'s snowing right now and has been since I got out of bed. It looks very beautiful and makes one feel excited about the upcoming Christmas Holidays. It\'s wonderful to see, as it is so bright and white! The weather can get really chilly though but it\'s all good, because at this time of year. The season is winter, and we all know what einter has to offer. Snow, snow and more snow. It makes you feel good and active. I personally enjoy the snow, and I like when it lasts.

1469^NR^O^activity8^I went to church. The only outside i have seen was walking from the car to the church and vice versa. It is very cold, and a decent amount of snow. I find the, winter to look very dull and depressing. The cold weather is not comforting and makes a me feel almost alone and vulnerable. I would much rather be warm then cold. Everything seems so barren when there are no leaves on the trees and everything is just white.

1263^NR^O^activity8^Today I went outside to walk my dog, and walked outside on a path in the forest. We played fetch, and I ran around chasing/ being chased by my dog. It was incredibly windy and snowy outside, and when I got home my cheeks were windburned bright red. The tennis courts were completely snowed over, and there was a layer of ice underneath the snow. It felt very isolated in the middle of the snowfield, and the snow was dazzling white. With the snow whiping around it feels like a very remote area in the wilderness and very away from civilization. I really love the weather, and find that if you bundle up in the right gear and boots that you can stay outside forever. I think going outside allows you to reorient yourself and completely forget about exams or any other stress going on.

I walked over to the washroom and turned on the florescent light that sits above the sink. The shinning light blinded me for a moment as I was used to the darkness of my room.  Reentering my room gain my eyes had to reajust but I felt really happy and almost excited at the prospect of jumping back into my warm bed in the embrace of a friend

My anxiety level went up and I doubt it will go down until exams are over. I looked at the clock and continued to get more anxious in calculating the amount of time before exams.  These are the only thoughts I\'ve had during exams week and I have had no time to relax much at all because exams are so close together.

I thought about my cousin\'s baby girl who was here all weekend, and how I really want a baby of my own, just not yet. I thought about my future, and when I would be able to have kids, with who, etc. I thought about my other cousin that we visited on the weekend, and how NOT to raise your children. I thought about how my cousin believes that my roomate and I are meant to be together, and whether that is true. Thought mainly about the future and my family.

As I was eating my warm chicken noodle soup I thought about how christmas was coming up and I became very excited.

1175^NR^O^activity8^Out side is snowing very wildly. There isn\'t more snow to come as predicted by the weather man. The snow keeps falling faster and faster. I feel that nobody has control over it and it just keeps falling at it\'s own pace. It is not going to last forever but it will last as long as it need to last without any regards for anybody. Snow and the wind push hard and hit my face until it\'s cold. My face is almost frozen so much that I start to feel some pain. Where we are is so cold that it get very depressing. Things in nature seem very quiet.. Occasionally I see a bird fly by in the snow looking for whatever bits of food it can find left behind during the fall. I\'m not happy by the sign of winter and hope that it goes by very quickly. I like snow because of all the fun activiities such as skiiing you can do. But, too much of snow isn\'t fun at all, shoveling it and trying to bare it while starting up the your car. I hope it\'s over soon because even teh days end early around 4:30pm. How sad is that. I sometimes ask why I live here in such weather I don\'t enjoy.

While watching tv, i felt down and upset so I felt like watching tv to relax and not think about my problems. After that, i went to my desk to start reading/studying for an exam. I felt attentive, alert and concentrated. Nothing was bothering me at the time, I was only focused on my studies. I couldnt anyone or anything distract my during my studies because I felt determined to get some serious studying done. However, while watching tv I could be easily distracted to get my mind off of things that were bothering me.

1496^CC^O^activity8^It is about 3 o\'clock (om) right now.  I woke up at about 11am, went outside to cash a cheque at about noon, and got home close to 1 o\'clock.  For the past couple of hours I have been trying to study while eating and reading and chatting at my parents\'s computer, as I came home for 6 days to study between exams.  I generally felt pressured during this time, and still am, to efficiently study my notes, do additional research, and catch up on the readings for my history exam.  Out of sync with the pressure I feel, I also feel relaxed and curious, and am taking breaks liberally to explore tangent subjects on the internet, such as nationalism and cosmopolitanism, Diogenes of Sinope, and trepenation.  My feelings of guilt about distracting myself are not as strong as one might assume, as I do not feel overly attached to the numerical assessment of my examination.  Not to say that I do not want to succeed, I do, and I am interested in European history.  However, my view of knowledge and education allows me to feel comfortable casually cruising the data banks of the internet to appease my thirst for knowledge on subjects that directly appeal to me.  I desire for my education to work for me, not to say that I do not need to work for my education, but I have a healthy degree of selfishness right now, I feel, and I am being accepting of the sense of balance it is providing me currently.  I also did not feel regretful about spending a large portion of time conversing with my friend Sebastian over MSN messenger, as the two of us always have very intellectually and sentimentally stimulating conversations, which I deeply value.  An idea for a short film project was also a product of this conversation, so although I may have lost time to studying, I do not sense a loss.  All in all, I am feeling \'happy go lucky\' and feel prepared for whatever the world has to throw at me, for better or worse.  I also know that I am going to spend tomorrow with a very close fiend/previous romantic interest who I do not get to spend time with often, so perhaps the sense excitement and feelings of joy I associate with this event is overshadowing and diminishing the relative importance of other events and activities and is providing me with a positive care-free outlook, but I feel content and optimistic, and am  happy to continue feeling that way.

1483^NR^O^activity8^I walked to work and walked past a cemetery and a forest. Blackbirds were swooping above my head and birds were chirping. It was really cold and the roads were full of slush. The pine trees and fir trees looked neat. They were a dark green and covered in white snow.

They are also very funny and do a great deal of things that make me laugh. They are excellent to pet and just hang out with and very loyal. Watching them all grow up is amazing since we have had them all since they were kittens. They all have such unique personalities and they are very apparent.

1466^CC^O^activity8^-Today while I was relaxing I couldn\'t keep my mind from racing. I had trouble just laying there without a thought entering my mind which would then lead to another, creating a cycle of really not relaxing at all.  -I couldn\'t help from thinking about what happened the day before, and I went through all the emotions that I had experienced yesterday. I felt myself overanalyzing a lot of what had happened simply because I was doing nothing else.

1219^NR^O^activity8^When I look out the window it looks gloomy. It makes me want to stay in bed all day. The clouds are thick and grey and fill the whole sky. All I could see out my window is a few tree tops. Usually there’s squirrels running around on them and birds that sit on the branches or fly by super fast. The branches aren’t moving, there’s no wind. It looks really quiet out there, makes me feel peaceful. I wonder what our world will look like in the next 100 years. It frightens me to think about that. Everything will be different, some species will go extinct and the weather will dramatically change. I wonder what’s going to happen to us and the planet. It kind of makes me feel helpless knowing that most people don’t care about how they are impacting the environment. Some third world countries probably aren’t even aware of global warming. Thinking that its part of earths natural cycles makes me feel a little more at ease. But it amazes me how we can play a role in changing such a big planet.

The lights are very bright there.  the walls and carpet are beige and boring, not very conducive to creative thought.  i feel sort of trapped at work.  the mall is not a particularly inviting place and i would rather spend my break time in out stock room than out in the mall.  everyone is cranky this time of year and there are crying and screaming kids everywhere.  i find solace in the backroom, but it is fleeting because there is always someone that needs my help.  it is a very draining workplace and the air is very dry.

1476^CC^O^activity8^Did not do much today. I slept thru most of the day. Since exams have been almost over, I\'ve been just working the night shift and sleeping most of the day. So, I spent today in my room, sleeping and surfing the \'net. Mostly I\'ve been feeling pretty neutral for the last few days. Thinking a lot about the OC Transpo strike and the fact that I haven\'t gone anywhere except to work for the last several days. The weather has also been poor and cloudy and rainy, so today it was very conducive to sleep. I just curled up in bed, warm in my hoodie and sweats, under the blanket. The mattress was so smooth (I find mattresses much more comfortable without sheets). The pillows were the only things in the bed that were cold. Just the way I like them. The room was dark (the beach-towel curtain doing its job perfectly), and the room was cold, again, conducive to slumber.     I haven\'t been feeling much excitement towards the coming of Christmas or New Year\'s. I have mostly been thinking about quitting my job, going over in my head the reasons I will outline on my resignation letter. About the bus strike, how I will REFUSE to buy a January bus pass, but will DEMAND to ride the bus in January on my December pass (all December pass holders should stand together on this one). Other than that, I\'ve been thinking about finding a woman, getting my own place, and seeing some friends that I haven\'t seen in a while. My parents\' anniversary is also coming up, and I have a great gift planned... I have to contact a friend regarding that as well.    I also thought a lot about going into business as I was on the Internet. I searched some well-known, obscure, Canadian, and other billionaires on the Forbes list and looked at their bios. I have several good business ideas and have been thinking about investing in a business property in my neighborhood for years. I think that I have a pretty good idea of what I want to do, products that I can offer, and where I can set up shop... It\'s really just the financing and the element of risk that keep me hesitant (in addition to the fact that I am still going thru uni)...

Today is my last exam and it is open book so I have been spending some time working with my printer.  Unfortunatley it has decided to act up on this day, so I have just spent the last hour or so figuring out how to get it to work.  As well, I have been trying to figure out the best possible way to utilize all of the space on my desk for studying, i.e, using my computer, having my notes out etc.

The floor is still cluttered with things in my room, things need to be organized.  I like the way my furniture is arranged, and I am happy with the way my room is.  I want my room to be cleaner.  I also want my house to be warmer.  I need more lighting in my room, and I need more shelving space to put books.  I also need more places to put my clothes, they are lying on the floor and hanging on my wall because there is not enough space for them right now.  Everything I encountered today in my environment I encounter on an almost daily basis.

I brushed my teeth, washed my face and drank my vitamins. I spent a few minutes on the computer checking my emails and then i started doing this survey. After i am finished i am going to go out and get something to eat. I haven\'t decided if im going to go to the gym today but i might. When i woke up it felt so bright because my blinds were open that i wanted to turn to the other side and sleep some more, even though i was not sleepy. I don\'t really have any big plans for today so im guessing that is why i feel that way.

I made myself some breakfast and read the comics in the newspaper for the first time in a very long time.  I then looked at pictures I took last night and thought about how much I missed my friends and how glad I am to see them again.  After that I watched TV for a while, mainly fashion television.  I thought about how I should have pursued a career in modeling as I won\'t be able to as I get older.  Then my mom came home and me and her talked for a while.  I love being in my home with my family.  It is such a safe and comfortable environment.

I went to visit my old high school and walking to portables is something I do not miss, at least Carleton has tunnels! My face was numb from the and I was only outside for less than 5 minutes. The snow seeped through my shoes and my socks were wet, which is not great, I have to say I wasn\'t particularly impressed with nature today. Although I do like my cloudy days so it was sort of nice to look at, with the white snow and all, but it was just too cold to stay out for too long. I met a small dog that came to one of the classes today. My former english teacher loves dogs so one of her former students brought their dog in and it was quite hyper. The trees don\'t have leaves except for the evergreens outside. And then dead evergreen in my house that is all dressed up in decorations. I do like the smell of a real tree though. There really wasn\'t much to see outside excpet for the blanket of white snow covering everything. The plants are covered and cold and will be for a few more months and the sun rarley comes out during this time of year, even when it is out it isn\'t warm. I prefer cloudy summer days, or cloudy fall days. Fall is my favourite season.

Then I went to my girl friends cousins birthday party.  He was turning seven (this was quite the treat if you can imagine).  The house we went to was filled with screaming kids and adults I hardly knew.  After the wonderful party, I drove home to eat dinner.

The sky is as blue as ever and even though it is windy - it looks as if the sun could be producing so much warmth and it tempts me to go outside. The wind howls in the background and it reminds me that as beautiful it is - it can be colder than I think. Th sun is so bright that the snow across the river is very bright so I\'m thinking I might be some shades.

I could just imagine them crashing up against the frozen beach; however, there are probably not many people around to actually see that. I could picture just a few birds actually soaring over the water, the winter is kind of a dead zone for mostly everything from animals to humans. Birds fly south, humans hibernate inside, it\'s kind of a depressant if you think about it.

It was very nice to see lots of people were out with their children in the parks, despite the cool weather.  I mainly noticed the ponds and big trees.  I don\'t think the ponds are \"natural\" but I like it when in the summer time ponds are a nice place to watch wildlife, like ducks and other birds.    The trees are very beautiful too, even when the don\'t have leaves.  These trees are very tall and tower over some builds surrounding the park aswell.  Trees are always nice to see, I wish they would plant more in city areas in and around in my home town.    Today was cloudy and sky was mainly grey, which never seems to bother me that much.  I know most people hate to see a grey sky, but somedays I just happy a can see a sky.

1401^NR^O^activity8^I work in an office building so the majority fo my day has been spent inside. I am facing a window, though so i still am exposed to nature to a small degree.   My building is in a shopping complex so the majority of what I see is parking lot and a few strategically placed trees. The building next to ours 9that i am somewhat facing) houses a family of crows/revens. or so i assume. they like to hang around up there, near the vents so im guessing they have some kind of nest or something. The building is too far off for me to see in detail, so Im pretty much left to speculate.  Im not really thinking about nature. when im at work im usually absorbed in the task at hand or some kind of socialization with co-workers. I am actually not very social and so each interaction usually ends up being over-analyzed by myself about a dozen times. Today I was supposed to have coffee/tea with a coworker but i dont think he wants to go anymore. So thats what ive been thinking about for the past few minutes, at least. It\'s the first sunny day out in a while and the weather is actually not too horrible. tomorrow and the following day temperatures are supposed to plummett so thats why i suggested we go today. Judging by the response i got and a general lack of enthusiasm (or maybe i imagined it?) i can guess that we\'re not going to go. This leads my mind to the next somewhat ridiculous thought of \"no one likes spending time with me.\"

1149^NR^O^activity8^I haev not done anything today that has to do with nature. I walked from my car to school and I\'ve been in classes all day. It was very cold outide, and I don\'t like winter at all. I think about how I would like to move to a country that does not have winter.

1205^CC^X^activity8^I was in class wondering why the class was so dry.  I was in an old classroom that made me feel like i wanted out as soon as possible. The walls were cream and dingey with red and blue seats and the floors were covered in salt,my thoughts were how much i felt like sleeping.no visuals

1538^CC^O^activity8^As the day is still young, I have only had the opportunity to watch the news and weather while enjoying my first cup of coffee. When I opened the curtains, the sun shone through the windows..it was a warm feeling. This should be a good day. Even though the idiotic bus strike is finally over, the buses are not running so I must drive my wife downtown so that she can spend the day with her friend.

1541^NR^O^activity8^Today my husband and I went for a walk in Rathrevor Beach Park.  It was so nice to be out and able to walk for a reasonable time (I recently had a op. on my hip which has restricted me somewhat!)this is the first time in months.  It felt so good albeit very very chilly especially beside the water.  The sun was peeking through too but there certainly was no heat from it!  But it was nice to see. There were lots of people out and about, most of them walking their dog/dogs.  The dogs all seem to be excited to see each other too, they played & chased with each other, it was fun to watch.  There were lots of waterfowl huddled together on the water and others flying overhead.    We were outside for about a couple of hours as I said very chilled but also very happy that we are so lucky to have such lovely areas so close to home.  Before going out I was in my small garden and the snow has more or less gone but there are my \"strong\" little snowdrops with their heads held high - I guess pleased that they made it through the heavy snow that was on top of them - I just love snowdrops - symbol of Spring for me(and strengh, I guess)  Other bulbs are beginning to peak out too - just wonderful that Spring is just around the corner, what a wonderful feeling!

1546^CC^O^activity8^I woke up around 8:00 this morning.  When I woke up, I spent time relaxing in bed, while I listened to music on the radio. I lay there staring at the stars on my ceiling and just let myself sink into my cushy bed.  I didn’t think about anything in particular, but rather I focused on the music playing on the radio. When I got up around 8:30, I dashed downstairs and gave my dog a big hug.  We then sat together for 15 minutes by my back window and watched a squirrel eating bird food from my bird feeder.  My dog smacked his lips, while I thought about what a gorgeous sunny (although cold) day it is.  I also thought about what a lucky person I am to have such a sweet, adorable dog.  During this period I felt very content.  When my dog became restless, I let my dog into our backyard and I proceeded to eat my breakfast.  As I ate my breakfast, I looked outside again and thought what a nice day it is today.  I also watched my dog run around the yard doing hilarious things (as usual).  During this period, I was savoring my breakfast (which happened to be very tasty), but I also thought about trying to find time to go outside and play with my dog in my backyard at some point today.

1601^NR^O^activity8^We are in the middle of \"a plague of locusts\" not real locusts, though many think cicada and locusts are the same thing.  New Zealand has about 20 different kinds of cicada and they are at plague proportions at the moment.  When I drove into a gas staion the other evening, the columns, pumps and windows were black with them. Millions upon millons, so I didn\'t get out of the car. I made myself shudder as I had to crunch over so many bodies to get away.  All around the house, their noise is deafening, so much so that you can barely hear yourself speaking to a friend, even if they are next to you.  So as cicada have a life-cycle between 13 and 17 years, there must have been a long, hot summer those years ago which resulted in the female laying many eggs in the bark if trees. They prefer pine and the larvae makes its way to the roots where, over a number of years it grows and pupates.  Then, on a hot day, at the appointed year, they emerge from the ground, shrug off their crysallis and emerge as great, green or black insects with lacy wings. The males make the noise (surprised? :-)  And in the next few days, attract a mate, then die. What a life.  It certainly makes me wonder what the point is. Are they just part of the food chain, is that what it\'s all about?    They must be a succulent snack for something; birds probably, but do they relish a surfeit of cicadas?  I am not one of these people who assume animals have no emotions; I\'ve lived close to them for long enough to know this is totally untrue. I\'ve even seen chickens being jealous and termperamental, so I\'m well aware that humans can be arrogant when they assume there is no feeling there.  But what about cicadas and spiders and crickets, do they too have an awareness?  I like spiders and wouldn\'t willingly kill them so I tend to think they have feelings. Does this mean then, that the way *I* feel is what colours my ideas about how *they* feel?  Perhaps its easier for me to kill ants when they get into my kitchen because I don\'t like them. Works for humans; the more we dislike people, the easier it is for us to abuse them.  Do cicadas have any process which makes them wonder why they must spend the majority of their lives underground and only 3 days in the sun?  That presupposes of course that being in the sun if prefereable to clinging to the root of a tree - and that\'s a matter of opinion.  I shouldn\'t like it overmuch but no doubt a cicadas has different ideas.  But has it?  Maybe it\'s all automatic, with no more feeling that the toaster which pops up when the bread\'s cooked.  A mechanical response to heat and light - whuch just happens to continue life for the species.  I often feel deeply sad when I\'ve sprayed ants and I was almost in tears when, once by mistake, I sprayed a spider and knew there was no way I could save it.  I apologised to it.   I wish there was a way of conducting one\'s life without killing things but there does not seem to be.  But then why do we think of death as a bad thing? It isn\'t really, just another fact; the end of life, neither sad not happy, just an event.  I\'m not afraid of death but I have a sneaking hope that there\'s something after life; I want another adventure and I tend to believe that the spirit or mind continues after the body had finished.  If it doesn\'t I won\'t be any wiser - but if it does - what an experience :-)    Maybe I\'ll come back as a cicada. Mental note: avoid gas stations.

1600^CC^O^activity8^I sat on the couch and worked on my laptop, but was continually interrupted by my own mind, leading me to look things up on the internet or find other distractions. I felt frustrated at my lack of attention span, and also frustrated at the difficult task I was working on, and how the difficulty was precisely what made my brain \"time out\" and go looking for distractions at such short intervals. The laptop heats up quickly, so it wasn\'t directly on my body, but I could still feel the warmth on my legs.

1577^NR^O^activity8^I have had limited exposure to nature and the outside world today. For the most part I have been working on my computer. I spent a few brief moments in the side garden this morning, letting my dogs out for the day. The dogs are beautiful. One of them is very old and requires a lot of attention. They are both always very glad to get out into the garden. I also took a moment to feel the gentle breeze on my face. From the window inside, I can see that it is a warm day - sunny with some cloud. I feel no compunction to go outside right now. Today is a \"blue\" day. I feel lonely and sad.
