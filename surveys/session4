1130^CC^O^activity4^My pleasent indoor place would be in my living room at my parents house. it is quiet when they are gone and the 3 dogs are not there. I enjoy sitting there and looking out. It is in the country, so it is quiet. I hear the sound of wind hitting the house. It smells like a mixture of a nice well kept house, yet has the lingering of dog. It is not bad though. It is normally warm when I am there becasue I turn the heat up. Around me is furnature from an auction. The dogs distroy everything so we bought less expensive funature until they grow up. It is a funny house with a mix of antique furnature, and newer things, but it all works together. There are no real noises around, except for the odd dog bark, or a neighbour in the distance cutting there lawn. There is a military base near by, so sometimes there are alot of plaines flying over the house. I like being in this room, I feel safe, happy, and content. The dogs make it a bit more lively when they are there.

As I picture this place right now, it is in the evening and the sun is just beginning to set. I can hear very little noise except for the odd cow from the barn and some birds around me. There is a little bit of wind and it\'s a fairly warm summer night.  There is no rain, only clear skies. The hay is prickly but is still comfortable to sit on. Some leaves on tree branches around me might be rustling in the wind. I would be able to smell the dried hay and freshly cut grass. There would be smoke coming from the boiler in a little shed behind me.

1123^NR^O^activity4^We used to have a cottage; when I was five, I think was when my family bought it. I\'m from New Brunswick, Saint John, and the cottage by a lake, very close to Saint Andrews, and it was quite far from home, so it was kind of nice to get away from it all. I think my brothers and I swam in the lake every day, sometimes all day. The roads were old dirt ones, where railroad tracks had been, but were now torn off, and if you walked long enough along the road, you got to this really thickly wooded area, my brothers and the neighbors told me it was called \"The Bluff\". and the bluff was this series of mini pathways, and if you climbed high enough, through pine needles pressing on your bare arms, and getting enough dirt in your shoes, you would get to a landing that overlooked the island in the middle of the lake. I\'d never been to the island, because there were signs that read \"No Trespassing\"; someone owned the island, and had a house there. The island really was only big enough for one house, I think. A house and maybe half an acre of land behind it. And it was always really curious to me, I tried to understand how someone could live so isolated like that.     And then we\'d take the paddle boats back, and eat spider-dogs and marshmallows at a neighbor\'s bonfire. It really was a magical place.

1093^NR^O^activity4^I am thinking about the river, where I used to live.  There were many sensory experiences there.  I remember the smell of the water throughout the seasons.  The smell and colours of leaves in the fall as they floated by in the water.  The rich smell of the water in the summer that was filled with weeds - it smelled rich and earthy.  I remember cutting and piling wood for winter.  The wood had a satisfying smell.  The burning wood in the stove was a beautiful smell - I love the wood smoke in the winter.  I could tell each different type of wood.  They each had their own smell.  I remember the calls of different birds.  I learned to recognize birds by their call living here.  The bluejays and cardinals were very loud, the owls and mourning doves were haunting, the cickadees were cheerful.  The herons sounded prehistoric.  I remember the deafening sounds of bullfrogs in June and packs of coyotes howling and crying at night.  There was always splashing from muskrats, particularily in the evening  when they would take you by surprise.  The river was full of sounds.  The colour of the water was always wonderful and changing.  On summer days it could be blue and green, on November afternoons it was black and a bit scary with white caps.  On evening in September it reflected the enormous rising harvest moon with a great streak of orange.  In the winter it was miles and miles of white.  As the river froze the most incredible souind was the shifting of large plates of ice.  They would make loud moaning sounds and the house would move a little when they shifted.

1133^NR^O^activity4^I thought about my backyard as it really is nice and beautiful back there. You can typically hear birds in the summer and see them flying around from tree to tree and onto electrical cords. You can continuously hear the wind rustling in the leaves on the trees and see them constantly sway in the breeze. When it rains you can hear the rain bounce off our deck and hit the pond . In the summer the backyard is filled with lots of laughter and chatter as people are relaxing on the deck enjoying the summer sun. I can see the colours of the leaves on the tree changing throughout the seasons, going from bright green to a yellow and red colour before falling to the ground for winter. You can see the changes in the garden over time as plants continuously grow and die. Despite the weather I consider my backyard to be a warm nice place, as I have so many pleasant memories back there. You can smell the flowers in the summer and smell the BBQ, and in the fall you can smell the coolness of the breeze.

I feel at ease, relaxed and a little tired. My comforter gives me warmth but there is a cool breeze coming from outside. It is summer time and it was raining all day so there is the scent of rain coming through the window from the tree.

When there, typical sounds I would hear would be the television, and a guitar from another room - otherwise it is quite secluded.  I would see a lot of neutral colours indoors from tans to deep, rich browns with deep red accents of blankets and a glass of wine. A blazing fireplace being the only source of movement and change - so unpredictable.  The textures of the couch and blankets are soft and plush.  It is warm, low lit and cozy.  I will usually be baking so the scent of fresh cookies fill the space and the aromas of a spiced, oaky glass of wine drift under my nose.

The only real sounds I ever heard, other than the television, were of crickets chirping or the low steady hum of the humidifier. It was a fairly small room, with only the essentials (and a TV) in it. I\'m not sure I understand the \"What would you see – colours and shapes, things moving or changing\" question...if it has to do with, like, hallucinations or something, then I can\'t say I saw any shapes/colours.    The textures were very rough. The walls were made of a very coarse stone which was very rugged to the touch. The floor was a solid slab of smooth, grey stone at some places, and carpeted floor at others. The carpet was very soft and almost soothing.     The room itself had a bit of a draft. It got chilly at night, unless you had a few spare blankets. The stone floor, in contrast to the rug, was very cold. It made for a bit of a nasty shock if you got up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom. It was fairly dry, which is why there was a humidifier, to attempt to fix that.    The scents were mixed together, often in a transparent attempt to mask a previous smell. Moth balls, Febreeze-ish product and deodorant were all clearly smell-able.

The sights was trees changing colour by the water and we (me courtney and joanna some great friends) put down an old blanket and wrote poems about life.

I felt great when i was there, there wants a care in the world, just hanging out with my friends for three days, writing about my life and how i felt, it was a great experience to get away from the world and just focus on me and think about how i was feeling.

The furniture didn\'t match as it was a collection from non-related students living together.  It was warm; it seemed like everything was radiating warmth.  The old hardwood floor was glowing brown, the setting sun cast some light through the drawn shades, and everything seemed very clear.  The couch I was sitting on had a torn and frayed armrest.  At the time, I thought it added character to the room...

1181^NR^O^activity4^In the past month or so while it switched to being fall from summer, i would walk my dog a lot and smell the smells of fall, see all of the leaves changing to yellow, orange and red. I like how all the leaves on the ground would run around with the wind and make a scratching noise. the textures are different depening on the leaves and whether they were dry yet or not, some of them would crunch under your feet and others would just remain whole. it\'s the kind of weather where you need a sweater but don\'t quite need a coat, it\'s still warm enough for that.

1209^NR^O^activity4^The place that I really have on my mind is back home and the places that I hung around with my friends in Korea.  Because the place I came from was really crowded  with people (unlike Ottawa). Even tho I really didn\'t like it, I really find it pleasant and I really hope to go back to it.  The place is really crowded with people (on the streets) and there are shiny things (items) that surround the streets as people are selling/looking/buying things at stores with shiny decorations.  As for the sound, because there are many people, it is really noisy with alot of pop music playing from many of the stores.  And I can really smell the food that people sell there. And becuse it is November, I see snow falling with the people wearing coats and scarfs.

1163^NR^O^activity4^I am thinking of a family vacation cabin on an island in Algoquin Park. The sun is about to set, and is beaming on the trees and water. The only sounds are of the occasional loon call, distant laughter from a cousin, and of water splashing up against the rocks on the island. The temperature is comfortable and mild. The air smells fresh and pure. The rock that I am sitting on is cool and very textured. The atmosphere is calm.

1116^CC^O^activity4^An indoor place that comes to my mind was an indoor pool when i vacationed in Florida. The sun was beaming through the glass and the smell of chlorine addressed the air. Ironically I was in Florida and in an indoor pool, but nonetheless is was refreshing. Palm trees lined the outdoors of the pool in a way you would see while driving through south central. I was very content as I was on vacation and away from work and school back home. It was only the first day that we were in Florida, so I had many days and fun activities to experience before the end of the trip. I specifically remember other people who were swimming in the pool that were almost in the same euphoria as I was, most likely due to them being on vacation and having the same feelings as I did.

I can just sit there and relax, there are always a few cats around who like to cuddle up next to me and purr or just sleep. Most of the rooms in her house are yellow, because she wanted a neutral color. It can be a bit cold there sometime, until the fire is put on.

I went here on vacation for the last to weeks of summer vacation. I remember walking along the cliffs overlooking the ocean. The air was very fresh and the cool breeze against my skin was amazing. You could sit in the barracks and hear the waves crashing up against the sandy beach. You could also hear bird in the distance. Somethings you can see boats sailing and it is just an all around amazing place to be.

We\'ve been going there on an irregular basis for more than thirty years so there\'s lots of memories of coming down river with the kids on their first canoe trip and andy and steve before that and then with the Bovas on the trip where richard lost his boat on the sidedam rapids and damn near lost his fiddle too and the kids went diving for the food and gear...there\'s another sense of history here too that\'s way deeper...a sense that there\'s been people stopping on this point for thousands of years and kids jumping off the skull rock and squealing as they hit the water and some guy standing out on the point as the sun drops over the sidedam rapids and the waters completely still so you canhear the rapids coming out of the sunset and you see the big V ripple of the walleye coming around the point from the big island and gull rock side and if you plop a williams into that school you pull in a tasty bit of fish flesh...if you can get in a boat ahead of that school and match their speed you can just keep pulling them in till you get a real nice feed of sweet sweet pickerel. If not you can troll the weed beds with a big ugly lure and some smelly pike will come up out of the shadows and attack...they can\'t help themselves...and then you\'ll smell like pike for days...

The days I like are really warm days with just a slight breeze to cool you down after swimming. My favorite thing to do is lie on the dock and feel the sun on my skin and listen to the wave move passed the dock. In the summer months we usually have a lot of visitors like family and friends so there\'s always people there having fun and laughing. A usual smell for a summer day like that is the smell of the charcoal BBQ and my dad\'s cooking. I like to look at the clouds in the sky and their reflection off the water. I don\'t really look for shapes in them like most people do I just look at the way the shape of the cloud changes in reflection.

My skin is very warm from the sun, and I can feel the sharp plastic of the beach chair pressing against my arms. I have my towel along the chair, so that is what I can feel under my back. I can smell the food coming from the restaurant behind me, garlic, cilantro, spices, and the smell of the ocean-- salty and fresh.

I loved the warmth of the sun beating down on the back of my neck, and the hot sand slipping through my toes. I loved going to bed and waking up to the sounds of the waves of the ocean crashing into shore. Every morning when I woke up we would always go on a walk down the beach. I loved running, and doing cart wheels down the beach front. All the beautiful seashells were scattered every where, and I collected the ones I loved the most. Sometimes if we were lucky, there would be some dolphins swimming in shore to try to catch some fish for breakfast. Such gorgeous mammals they are. Some scents that I could definitely describe is the smell of fresh salt water, the smell of chlorine by the pool, and the smell of fish down by the boardwalk that the pelicans were waiting to be fed.Yes Florida is a beautiful place that I miss very much since it was a part of my childhood, and I can\'t wait to go back hopefully sometime soon!

1178^CC^O^activity4^The pleasant indoor place that I\'m thinking of is my friend\'s cottage. I would hear the crackling of the fire in the wood stove, the flow of water from the nearby river and the crickets cherping outside. I imagine it to be dark and to see shadows of objects and of the people when they move around the room. It feels warm and dry from the fire. I feel the softness of the blankets on the couch. I also imagine the pleasant smell of the wood stove burning firewood.

It\'s very quiet and relaxing. The colours are very tropical and bright and vibrant. The water is crystal blue with pink sand. There are few people there when I visit late at night, when it is semi cool, but it is still warm and lovely. The smell of the salt water is overwhelming and warming.

1263^NR^O^activity4^Grandbeach in Winnepeg, Manitoba is a very crowded beach, usually filled with people, and kids running around. You can hear laughter, sometimes bees, the wind, and splashing on the water. The sand dunes are completely silent and relaxing with the occasional muffled noises from another area in the dunes. The sand is burning hot in the dunes, and is the perfect place to relax and tan. There is a pipping plover district that is sectioned off, since they are endangered and there are quite a few groundhogs, squirrels and other small wildlife that pass through the sand dunes in the vegetation. There are also campground barbecue smells that waft along certain points. Near the concession stands it smells like fries. During fish fly season the edge of the water will sometimes stink from the dead fish flies. The beach is very brightly lit up with clear water and bright coloured beach umbrellas, swimsuits, and blankets along the water. The texture of wet sand as you walk along the edge of the water feels rough and like quicksand and is refreshingly cool after burning up in the +30 degree weather. The regular sand tends to be hot, and has shiny quartz stones and a bunch of other varieties.

The sounds that I hear are those of people talking, the ocean waves breaking, birds, Caribbean upbeat music, wind, the palm trees moving in the wind. The things that I see are the beach, sand, people, the sun, the trees, clouds, boats, surfers. The things that I feel are the sand, the water when I go in it, the hot sun, the sun tan lotion I put on myself, the wind. It is usually very hot and dry when you are out of the water, but when you are in the water its refreshingly cool and wet ( obviously). The scents that are noticed are mainly sunscreen, and sun tan oil...also the salty breeze from the ocean water.

1262^CC^O^activity4^The place that I chose is my work, at a community center where I work with a variety of ages of children.  I always feel very content to be there, as it is truly enjoyable, and yes, stressful at times. Sounds I would normally hear are the laughing and speaking of children and staff. I can also hear the water running from the washrooms, and activity going on in the gym ( a ball game, frisbees being thrown, skipping ropes,hand clapping games, etc.)I also hear noises coming from the kitchen , wether it be a bowl being mixed or cutting up food.   As for sight, there is an array of things that come into my vision on a daily basis. For one, I see the smiling children who always make me feel very happy and proud of my job, and I see every room in the community center, I see the front desk and community members looking for information on some of our programs for children and adults. I see craft,gym and kitchen supplies in each room\'s cupboard/closet. I see the artwork on the walls, giving the center a warm,welcomed feeling to visitors and the workers. Because the center is targeted for young children, there are bright colours and many simple shapes for children to look at.   The textures in the center are truly a variety of many things - smooth chairs, rough carpet,warm center,etc. It is important to present the children with various stimulating examples for their growth when they are at the community center. It is also important to me to be the best I can be for the children, in the sense of keeping them safe, provding them with new, creative activities that they will get excited about, and games that they have never played before.

1298^CC^O^activity4^the place that i am discussing is Fuschl Am See, a small picturesque town near Salzburg in Austria.  it is the most beautiful place i have ever visited. i went there with my best friends and we were in a honeymoon suite in a hotel that was designed to look like a barn on the outside (this is my best male friend and i).  there was a beach located outside the hotel but since it was March here was still snow and ice.  it was relatively cold while we were there but the sun brought lots of warmth.  we were able to find these incredibly smooth rocks located along the beach.  one morning there was a parade because it was Palm Sunday and so the citizens of the town were parading with palms and singing and it was really neat.  we could sometimes hear the cracking of ice as it melted, we could hear birds, but we could also hear a lot fo silence.  there were very few cars so we could really just listen to silence or to one another.  as we were sitting on the beach one day we noticed that we could see the most incredible view of the alps.  they were so big and gargantuous and beautiful and powerful, making me feel small in a positive way.  it really showed me that little things don\'t matter that much in life because some things are so much greater.  it helped me to see how truly wonderour God\'s creation could be.  i loved it here.  so old fashioned, and quiet and just such a perfect place for me to spend time with him and talk to him.  while it was cold and wet and this sounds awful it was the ebst kind of cold and wet you could experience because this place was so pleasureable.  i could often hear our other friends laughing and joking as well. at night you could hear traditional music going on inside the local bar and hear the sounds of everyone laughing and drinking up and having a good time. it was a beautiful place.

The porch doesn\'t really have a noticeable scent.  This place is my favourite indoor place because it is so comforting.

Sometimes it\'s just the ceiling staring into nothingness. There s a gradual change in the cleanliness of my room, things constantly getting shifted but nothing too noticeable comes or goes. Except on some occasions. It\'s sometimes cold but then i just put the heat on. So it\'s usually room temperature. Pleasant smells are due to the air freshener.

As I look out on the balcony I see the lake ahead of me as well as the huge hill. I look to my left and I look to my right and all I can see in forest surround me. And I also see the raft and the dock with the boathouse - which is wonderful to be on in the summer of a nice warm day. It\'s very nice, warm, and relaxing. All I can smell around me in the nature.

What was once a vast view of mountains and landscape becomes enclosed, full of shadows that blend into complete darkness. Candles flickering, soft glow. Small white lights twinkling at the bar and throughout the venue. Earthy/natural colour scheme: white with accents of green, taupe and brown.      Touch: Lounging on soft cushion, leaning into softer pillows... Lots of cottons and silky fabrics. Furniture is wicker, brown and glossy. Warm plates and food, cold glasses, material serviette.

1242^CC^O^activity4^I\'m thinking of my nonna\'s basement, a place that i have always loved. If i were there, I would most likely be sitting on the light brown couch with very faint white swirl things. It\'s against the far wall (looking from the stairs). If i look straight ahead, theres the random pole in the middle of the room in which i swing around at least twice when im in timmins. And then theres the bar on my left hand side, the one with a wooden bottom and a marble counter. There are so many different bottles of alcohol, both empty and full, and partly full. there are sooo many and theyre all on this shelving unit attached to a mirrored wall behind the bar. Then theres a poster of the country Italy as it would be on a map, but it has a soccer shoe on the tip. Its been there for so long, at least since ive been born. The carpet is brown, as our the walls and closets in there. The carpet is really wooly and comfy to walk on. I always love going down those steep, comfy stairs to the basement. The one thing that defines that room, and the whole house, is the smell. It\'s a combination of the laundry room beside the basement room and my nonna\'s cooking in the kitchen. It is an amazing smell and every time i smell it or something like it on a random day, i think of timmins and my nonna\'s house. My nonna\'s house is actually one of my favourite places to be in the world! Back to the basement, theres a church piew against the wall with two pictures of ships and fishing nets above them. I can picture them perfectly right now. It\'s great, and theyve also been there for so long. underneath the piew are bins full of the toys that my younger cousins play with when they come over to my nonnas. and then, on the wall near the closets is the little cupboard/armoire that holds all the \'nature videos\' of different animals. when I was younger, me and my sisters always watched those, especially the cheetah one! they were so exciting and we constantly watched them whenever we were over there. sitting on the couch, theres a window right above me with these blinds that are made up of long felted rectangles and the thing you pull to make them go to one side is the typical string made up by tiny metal balls. outside the window is the grass!! and i can see the grass outside cause were below ground in the basement, obviously. On the other side of the room, theres a smaller window that is on the wall right next to the stairs. This window is extremely clear in my mind. its really small and it opens sideways, but very little. we always know when company comes to nonnas house because of that window: we see the guests walk by that window, their feet, though. so we always expect someone to walk in the house when we see those feet pass. I could spend my whole day in that basement, its wonderful!!! while i sit on that couch, i could hear the faint footsteps of the people upstairs and even the commotion in the kitchen, like pots and pans and fiddling of dishes and such. and sometimes when im there, my sisters play the piano so its possible that id hear that right above me. the tv, which is right across the room from the couch im sitting on, is sort of big, but not gigantic, and its new!! i remember my nonna telling me that she won it in a sweepstakes in the newspaper!!! oh its wonderful..and i remember its really good quality, unlike the old black one she had...i lov e itt

In this place I see a lake, birds, people, some grasses, trees, a road for walking around the lake and the sky. I feel wonderful sitting there, the textures that i litterally feel is hard wood underneeth me and peace around me. It is warm, because i only usually go to sit there in the summer days and it is dry. The scent is clear and non polluted unlike the street just outside this place.

Sitting on the beach, surrounded by pine trees that grow just beyond the edge of the sand and looking up to the cottage which is about 20 feet away.  I hear the sounds of water gently lapping on the beach, see the children splashing, laughing and playing in the water.  I hear the breeze rustling through the trees, and hear birds chirping.  I smell sun tan lotion, and the nice warm summer breeze that floats by me.  I feel the sand on my toes as I dig into the cool deeper sand on the beach and feel my towel as I lean back in my chair to soak up the warmth of the sun.  I can hear snippets of conversations coming from near by cottages and cottage door slamming as people come and go.  I feel the warmth of the sun on my skin and take a relaxing breath and close my eyes to fully enjoy the moment.

The sounds i would hear there would be those of animals, insects, trees, water and pretty much anything that involved nature. Things that I would see there would be plants, animals and at the end of the summer the leaves sometimes even started to change because it was so far up north. It was quite a beautiful place.It was usually not extremely hot but pleasently hot or a little bit cooler. It usually did not rain a lot but when it did it rained the entire day.The scents that i noticed there were fresh air, different plants and wild flowers and the trees.

1325^NR^O^activity4^In my backyard at home, you can usually hear the tree frogs, which don\'t croak so much as chirp.  And of course you can hear the crows which my mom insists on feeding.  Every once in a while you hear a car speed by the house, ignoring the speed limits because there is rarely other traffic or police where we live.  The wind in the trees makes the pine needles rustle, and occasionally you\'ll match a falling pine cone with a small thud sound.  The squirrels are fun to watch, especially when \"Big Red\" and \"Captain Blacktail\" chase each other along the fence.  I\'ve always wondered how long squirrels live.  The backyard is fairly esthetically pleasing, except for the grass beneath the pine trees.  The needles have a certain type of acid in them that kills the grass, leaving it crispy and brown to walk on.  I\'ve only been at home for summers recently, so I\'m picturing it pretty warm, and sunny.  We have a pool, but I despise swimming, so I\'m going to say I\'m pretty dry too.  It\'s a nice place to be.

1277^NR^O^activity4^Last Spring Break me and 10 of my closest friends went to Dominican for a week. The best night was when we went down to the beach at around 1am and sat right where the water was washing up onto the sand. There were other people there so you could hear people laughing and talking. You could also hear the sounds of the ocean and of the wind running through the palm trees. Every once in a while you could see a large fish jump out of the ocean and hear the splash it made as it fell back down. Once in a while, someone would break out into a song and we would all start singing. The song would usually end in all of us breaking out into laughter, then settling back down to focus on the nature around us.Since it was so early in the morning, everything was black and you could barely see the person sitting next to you since it was so dark. You could just barely make out the outlines of all of the trees. We could see our hotel in the distance and the pool with lights at the bottom, but the closer we would walk towards our hotel the less we could hear people talking and the less we could hear the ocean. We were sitting on the sand with shorts on and the sand would glue itself onto our legs. We would rub our toes in the sand which felt nice. Even though it\'s very early in the morning, it still feels warm, only with a slight breeze, which felt nice. You could smell the ocean and the seaweed. Everyone was very happy. No one was thinking about the work they\'d have to do once they returned home or the people they\'d have to face. Everyone was completely calm, completely relaxed and completely happy. The only time anyone was sad was when we\'d start to discuss our trip home the next day!

My cousins, my sister and I would always be out doing different things.I remember fishing in the huge row boat that we had. I still remember the way the oars us to make my hands feel almost a bit burnt at the begining of the summer until I got use to it. The smell of the worms, fish and water are still vivid in my mind. I even remember the sound of the oars hitting the boat when we would put them in their resting spot when we werent using them.   I also remember swimming. The water had a very distinct smell to it. The way my hair would feel the first time I went under water. How the boats sounded under the water. There was one part of the shore that had a lot of rocks and there were quite a bit of fish there. I use to snorkle there and just watch the fish. It\'s proably why I have sooo many fish today. It was nothing to see hawks flying around. Our part of the lake was a dead end so not many people would go that far. This made it perfect for the loons to come and hang out. I still remember watching many sunsets and hearing the loons. I also remember the amazing thunder storms we would have. The thunder would echo off of the hills that were all around and it was soooo loaud. Wow... this all kind of made me sad...

1201^NR^O^activity4^I thought of camping, probably in the White mountains of New Hampshire. Sometimes in the summer my family would go down for 2 or 3 days to go hiking. Hiking was alright but just hanging out at the campground was pretty good. What I find interesting about mountains is that as you begin the air is very damp while in the forest. As you ascend the mountain the air becomes crisper and cooler as the tree\'s become shorter and more sparse. Soon you are out of the tree line and completely exposed to the elements. It could be fiercely sunny or torrential rain, you really have no idea so you had to pack for both occasions. The most rewarding part of hiking is being in that position. You\'re above the tree line and hopefully there are no clouds so that you can actually enjoy the view that you walked so far to enjoy.

1111^NR^O^activity4^The place that I remember is a cottage near Georgian Bay. It was so peaceful and my favourite moment while being there was the sunset. Sitting on the beach listening to the waves wash up on the shore. It was nice and warm and felt so relaxing. The sun was gorgeous and it\'s not something that I get to watch often so it was nice. The trees behind on the shoreline were rustling with the wind. The smell was fresh and just nice to be around because it felt so natural. We walked along the beach which is full of small rocks which is not the most comfortable thing to sit on. We watched the sunset and threw rocks into the water.

1306^CC^O^activity4^At a friend\'s house in the country, up on a hill, I enjoy sitting in front of the big stone fireplace while it burns and crackles. I sit in silence as the warmth makes me tired and I watch the snowflakes fall around outside. The wind on the trees moves the snow in whirlwinds often. I think about life, about what I\'m doing and why. It allows me to have some quiet time to myself. The evergreen trees are so full of snow it looks as if they will fall over, while the stick trees, also look like they\'ll fall over from the wind on the hill. The fire grows larger as someone refills it will logs, crackling more and more. I sit on a comfy burgundy and brown floral couch, falling into the warmth of the fire, not even needing a blanket I\'m so close. If a voice comes in the background to talk to me, I do not hear it as I\'m too intrigued with watching nature, thinking in a different time of society. This living room is my favourite place; quiet, warm, and homey.

1327^NR^O^activity4^The last time I can remember being very happy outdoors was at Burns Water Gardens in Baltimore Ontario. I worked there for an entire summer, and though it was hard labor when you could take a break and look around it was actually very pretty.  Working there you hear all kinds of things. Frogs croaking is what I remember the most, followed by the wind through the trees, the sounds of the dilapidated carts we had to lug around and the laughing of my co-workers when one of us would fall in mud or drop a water lily. There was also the sound of customers browsing through the greenhouses, the barking of the owners\' dog Sparkle, and the squawking of their peacocks. As everyone knows this was the wettest summer in a long time if not ever, and my favorite sound was the hard rain hitting the many ponds we had on the property. What I remember seeing, is green. Green grass, greet plants, green leaves, everything was green and it was beautiful.  Everything felt rough, because everything was rough and/or gritty but it was a pleasant \"I\'m working hard texture\". For the majority of the summer it was wet, but it was also warm so again it was just a very pleasant place to be. The smell of the outdoors, the smell of dirt, pond water, algae, Sparkle, and of course Bob the owner who I think bathed in the ponds. It was a relaxing, pretty environment.

Its very warm sitting next to the fire.  I can hear the fire crackle as the wood shifts around in the fire place.  Looking out the great display of windows I see the peaceful white snow falling over the magnificent landscape.  Occassionally there is a roar of a snowmobile jetting across the lake.  There are makeshift ice huts out on the frozen lake filled with men fishing in the ice waters.  There is no one else there and I am enjoying the warm fire whilst rapped in a furry blanket.

It is silent and still, except for pale flakes of snow drifting lazily to the ground. It smells of winter, air so cold that it feels wonderfully fresh.

1269^NR^O^activity4^The place that I think of is the barn. The different sounds that i hear there are the horses snorting and neighing as well as the broom. The broom sweeps the floor in motions that sound so soothing. Sometimes in the barn when its busy there is lots of chatter from many different people but when you enter the horse\'s stall there is no one but you, unless you\'re talking to someone haha which is frequently the case for me when i go. The colours vary from season, on hacks outside in the winter its freezing and white but in the fall it\'s so very pretty with all the fall colours. The scents that I notice is the sweet aroma of horses, im nottalking about manure but horses have a distinct smell and its wonderful. The different things I feel varies from rugged leather to soft new leather, to the soft nuzzle of the horses or the furry body and even the wispy tail.

1236^CC^O^activity4^The indoor place I chose is the daycare I went to when I was growing up as a child. It was located inside the elementary school I attended, and I would go there everyday for several hours after school until my parents were finished work. Inside the building we mostly heard children, as the main lobby to the daycare center had doors leading to all the rooms for different age groups. I was in the youngest age group, so the room I was located in was very noisy and full of kids playing. I remember hearing the sounds of games and movies, kids laughing and having fun. The room was decorated with just about every color you could imagine - with lots of things to look at that might help children of my age group in learning and development. I remember there being lots of toys to play with of different textures, as well as a section for arts and crafts in which we were able to feel different materials and use our creative imaginations to make anything we wanted. The room is cold and warm. During the summer, when kids are there for full days, this is useful due to the fact that there are certain times set aside in the days for \"reading time\" or \"nap time\". I would notice hardly any scents, the daycare team never wore perfumes. Generally all I would smell is glue from arts and crafts, and the smell of food when it came to be snack time.

I may begin to hear music or the sound of a movie, but only if instigated by me. I would see light and blissful colours that are warm and inviting, i would see patterns on the walls and shapes of furniture. Things around the room feel soft and silky yet bold. It is a moderate temperature, it would be cool, but just cool enough that my toes could just comfortably rest underneath the blankets while i read in bed. It is definitely dry and i can smell the scent of clean sheets, with a rosemary aroma circulating around the room.

It was warm and the air was filled with the scents of nature

1343^NR^O^activity4^The Blue Mountains in Australia are filled with amazing scenery and a calming atmosphere. There is minimal sound when you are there - you hear the rustle of trees when the wind blows by, and the occasional call of a bird. The colours are very dark, yet feel bright. When standing on top of one of the mountains, looking out, you can see for miles; the deep blue sky a backdrop against the dark green of the many trees on the peaks and valleys below. It is neither cold nor warm; it is completely neutral and relaxing. It is dry for now, but there has been rainfall on and off for the past few days, so everything is slightly damp. It smells like you would expect a forest to smell, a place dense with trees and greenery, and inhabited by coutnless animals.

Here I would find lighting in the entire house but only lights on in rooms that were being used, I would hear the tv possibly, the computer but I would also hear the sound of laughter and my 11, and 13 yr old cousins with their friends. The smell would smell something like my aunt in a good way, with a combination of whatever was cooking, a home feeling. The living room wall was yellow with wall paper on the one side, and the room I stayed in was pink. The place feels like home its warm, dry and the couces are soft the chairs are comfortable.

From my room you could hear almost nothing, it was dry and hot, no rain or snow, just silence and the sound of the water. I always watched TV, whatever was on at that time. The rooms were colors of tans, oranges, yellows, and greens, reflecting the warm neutral tones to calm you. It was always cold, a drastic difference from the dry hot hot heat outside, and the cool air often created cold sweats if you lay under the blankets.

1326^CC^O^activity4^The place I\'ve chosen is a room in my grandparents house. It\'s a place where I\'m wholly comfortable and relaxed. The most important aspect of this house is the scent. The minute I open the door to the house my arms sink a little lower and you can feel some of your tension melt away. The nicest part is that the scent stays on your clothes for a couple of days and every once in a while you get a little glimpse of it.  There is a particular room that I stayed in when I was a little girl, I think that\'s why it\'s my favourite. There isn\'t really anything special about it... in fact, most of the bedrooms are pretty boring. There is a picture of Jesus on the mint-green walls... and a scratchy yellow blanket on the bed... The floor creaks every time you step on it (which made sneaking out of your room at night impossible) It\'s warm because of the wood stove on the floor below... and you can smell that too. The only other sound is of laughing in the kitchen, the heart of the house, and the train that goes by a few times a day.

1319^NR^O^activity4^Everything was green and full of life. I was in a hiking trail in a forest. If I looked up, there was a green canopy from the leaves. I remember feeling very calm. The light from the sun glowed through and I just thought it was the most beautiful thing. I always look for it when I\'m in a forest, the roof of green. I could smell the freshness of the air, and the scents of trees, grasses and a few flowers were all around me. There were few wild flowers, and they were small, but they were beautiful. Everything relaxed me and I felt very connected with nature. I was with my family, but none of up were talking, we were just enjoying the nature around us. I recall hearing the wind blowing through the trees, but it was very gentle. There were lots of birds singing, and they sometimes flew past. I didn\'t see very many animals. I remember looking down at the path and noticing the roots that would show. I followed their path with my eyes to examine the tree that they came from. I would look at the tree and notice all of the tiny life it had. Spiders and ants and other insects would crawl along and I was so captivated by them. It\'s amazing how beautiful a spider can be. There was a brook nearby and I looked at the bottom and noticed just how clear the water was. It looked perfect. I would look at the pebbles inside and I liked how the water made them look so shiny. The weather was great. It was a warm, sunny day. I enjoyed the time I spent there.

There\'s a slight chill rolling off the lake but the day is nice and bright.

The sand was warm and quishy to the feet and the ground was hot, the water was cool and very relaxing. People are talking, walking, swimming and suntanning everywhere you go. The food was nothing special, but it kept you going. The festivities were unstoppable, every night there was something going on and they made the littlest of things were such a big deal. With a live band every night and the soothing yet upbeat sounds of mexican music filled the air, it was breathtaking. I would go back any day.

It is usually cold and dry in the room but this outside cold usually makes curling up in a blanket and relaxing much better.  I can sometimes hear Adam making food in the kitchen, but it is very quiet and almost relaxing to sit there and relax while everything else is still going on around me.  I can see and hear various cars driving by and neighbours walking their dogs and the snow falling which makes sitting there curled up even more relaxing and cozy.  From the front window of the room the light shines in and I can see the sunset.  The couch that I sit on is a giant sectional that\'s microfiber and it\'s very soft and comfortable.  When I first sit it is usually cold but warms up very quickly.  The pillows and duvet I take from the bed and the weight of the duvet makes it more warm and comfortable.

When there are other people at home other than me, is when I feel the most safe because I know that other people are there with me. I see furniture, and people, and animals. It is warm and smells like Febreze watermelon because we use that to freshen up our house.

1275^NR^O^activity4^One of the most amazing places I have ever been was DOminican Republic. Every night, I would tie up my pink Nike Shox, get into my spandex and sports bra and run along the beach in the warm white sand. I would strap on my iPod and would listen to my favorite songs while watching boats along the horizon as tiny tlights. Unlike Toronto, I could look above and actually see stars. If I took my headphones off, I could hear chatter and caribbean music vblaring from the 24 hour bar when teenagers, much like myself were drinking recklessly. The palm trees would sway so slightly some nights, and other nights they would be waving wildly on as the wind tore through my hair and threatened me to run a little farther and a little faster. Along the beach, lawn chairs and bodies littered the beach. Usually these bodies would be tangled together in a drunken mess surrounded by scattered beer cups filled with cheap beer. And every night I promised myself that I ouldn\'t be one of htose inebriated bodies that lay carelessly across the warm sand in the heat of the night. But, as the week wore through I caved to the temptation of the deep blue skies, crashing waves, and other drunken dreams of drunk dominican nights. I was that body tangled among a sexy boy whose name I fail to remember.

My apartment has been redecorated four times, by myself, and is now a combination of black and white patters, an electric blue, and a pastel blue, with self-created art the size of my walls and windows that stretch the entire width and height of my apartment. lots of natural light, warm colours, bright open spaces, and home-made touches. Probably exactly what you guys are looking for. Also, I ALWAYS have music playing (slightly addicted). Lately I am into ambient, relaxing music and I don\'t know alot of the songs so I can easily relax.

1363^NR^O^activity4^The place I am thinking of is a cottage I went to when I was in France. There were trees surrounding us everywhere. I can remember the first time I stepped out on the balcony. I was surrounded by the sound of the trees in the wind. It was a warm but very windy day. The area actually made me think of home because the landscape was so similar. I can hear the people that I was with talking with their beautiful accents about where we\'re going to go eat tonight and what else they want to show me in the area. It is green all around us. Not much color was found only different shades of green. The feeling was so calming and the smell was fresh, pure. It was one of the most beautiful sights I had ever seen.

It is quite cold and usually pretty wet. Overall the main sent is that of a stagnent water or the smell of the pulp and paper mill that is 10 minute drive away.

I would see the sunlight shinning down on me. It is very hot and relazing. I am lying down on a towel feeling the sun and letting the world stay still for just a bit. My feet are lying in the sand and I am just fpcusing on breathing in and out. I smell the ocean and ocasonally hear little children running by. I am on an almost secluded beahc so there are not to many people around.

1407^NR^O^activity4^I remember being in my grandfather\'s farm. I would hear the chatter of the workers on the field, the soft hum of machinery. From a nearby tree, I would hear the chirps of many different birds. The wind would russtle occasionally and the dry leaves and hay on the ground would move and tumble on the dry earth. I would also hear the sounds of frogs for they are usually everywhere in that farm. I would see rows and rows of rice plants, green, and protruding from the water. In the distance, tall mountains would come into view, grey and green. Occasionally I can see birds flying from the top of the mountain. The place is hot and dry, but not humid. It is a different kind of hot than here in Canada. I would feel my grandfather\'s hand clasped in mine, rough and ragged from working at the farm. The scent I smell is of grass, standing water and of animal feses nearby.

There are trees are behind me in some sort of forest. i Picture a beach island. I see the colour blue for the sky, white for the clouds, and yellow for the sand. There are alot of people playing volleyball in my vision and lots of people just relaxing and tanning and also running around making sand castles or swimming. I feel good today with the warmth of the sun on my face. It is a good day for the beach is what it feels like

1364^CC^O^activity4^I think the most pleasant I experienced was on a cruise ship, sitting in my room window.  The room was as low on the ship as it could be, and the water was so close.  I watched it moving so peacefully around the ship, rippling so gently on the open water.  The sun was bright and warm, on my face.  The hum of the ship was evident as well as the poelpe moving about in the hall, however, when I closed my eyes, I imagined hearing the water gently bouncing off the side of the ship.  I imagined birds flying about and soaring gracefully.  To be honest I don\'t think I was paying any attention to the smell of my cabin.  The window was round, and cradled my body gently, almost in a foetal position. It was like an escape from the hustle of everyday.

1402^CC^O^activity4^A pleasant indoor place i can remember is from my 11th grade of high school. It was called the student leadership room and i was a huge part of our leadership group. My friend Miles and I used to spend our spare in that room just hanging out. It was a tiny little room with no windows and one door. There was an art desk on the left wall of the room, it was used to make posters and decorations for all the events for students throughout the school year. The back wall of the room just had decorations/posters pilled up against it from past events and the greatest part of the room but against the right wall. It was this large green velvet couch. It was so comfy that most spares miles and i would just fall asleep on that couch. This room was located in student services so whenever we went there to do homework we could always hear the hustle and bustle of students coming and going for guidance appointments.The walls were just white and it had an old musty smell in that room but i always came back day after day to hang out with that boy i first met in grade 9 science class. It was a chilly room so sometimes he would lend me his sweater or something. I will always remember that room and smile because of it; i fell inlove for the first time in that room.

I noticed many pleasant smells of Chinese food being served and eaten.

1361^NR^O^activity4^A pleasant outdoor place that I like to visit is the arboretum across from Carleton. There is an area that I particularly like to go to. It forms a little niche in between some shrubs and trees. It is off the pathway so not many people walk by and can disturb me. There is an occasional bark in the distance from darks reminding me that there are other people around. I also see squirles scampering by but never hear their movements unles they are clawing up a tree. The branches from the tree hang down loose allowing them to be swayed calmly in the wind forming a slight relaxing swishing sound. The grass underneath me feels both at the same time dense yet comfortable to sit on. The ground recently has become colder, but eventually heats up after I have been sitting there for some time. I do not take particular notice to any scents in this location.

This is one of my most favourite places to visit in the summer/fall and is actually where I plan on being married, this coming October/09. It is always hot there when I go and it smells of farm animals, mostly horses and cows. You can see visitors snapping pictures, wandering around the village. Those who work at the village are in old-fashion uniform and are very informative. You can hear the visitors asking questions and the workers answering promptly. You can see all types of farm animals running (for the most part) loose, such as chickens, pigs, rabbits, geese, ducks, cows, oxen, horses, etc. It feels different in this setting - kind of like I am in a whole other world. It is pleasant and nice, and there are wonderful vegetable and flower gardens. It is right a long the river and you can take a boat ride.

The seagulls and geese are mostly calm, and there are various musical buskers at their work: pan flute artists and guitarists.  A few children play at the playground a few hundred feet away, their numbers dwindling as their parents come to pick them up. Art school students come and go.  It\'s a moderately dry summer evening, the sun coming down, and the temperature teetering on requiring a long-sleeve shirt. or a light sweater because of a barley noticeable breeze.  The grassy hill on the corner of granville island overlooks a tiny mock-amphitheater with benches of wood and false creek all the way to science world.  The cambie street bridge become illuminated from underneath by purple lights, casting a glow on the heavy concrete, reflected by the water underneath.  The noise from traffic from the granville bridge overhead is there, but it\'s minimal.  My girlfriend is sitting on my lap and we take a moment from talking to watch the stars join the colourful paper lanterns above us.

My apartment is almost always neat and organized. Everything is where it should be and things are always tidy and clean.

1395^NR^O^activity4^The most pleasant outdoor place I remember the most was when I took part of a class camping trip in Earth and Space Science class in grade 12 to Algonquin National Park, in 2006. The duration of the trip was 3 days all together, but it was on the second campsite that took the biggest impact to my memory.     Upon arrival, my particular group had the opportunity to camp on what the teacher of the class had called \"the patio\" for it was located farthest from the rest of the other tents for it was right near a beautiful lake and on it\'s own rock like platform.     When everyone else had embark on a swimming party to a small island on the far side of the campsite, i had stayed at the foot of the water near my group\'s tent. It was such a sight.     Since it was the fall, no bugs were around due to the cooler temperature, so it was nice to avoid them bloodsuckers. The lake was quite large, for it had a few islands. But, it was just the view of the leaves that was breath taking. All the bright colours that danced as the cool wind blew across the water, rippling in wonderful fashion.    Though i had said it was fall, the day was just marvelous, the sky was clear and blue, and the sun bright as usual.    I forgot the term for it, but the water of the lake basically lacked the necessary conditions for fish, so it was completely dead. No plant grow water so ever. And i remember that i had just refilled my water but i got my shoe wet when i was walking down the steepish slope. And it was quite funny.    It was essential hte perfect view you want to see before you die. Or the perfect place to have your ashes spread across.     The forest behind me was also another adventure; one i eventually did after sitting there, but for that one i just want to say the quietness of it was impossible to describe. One would was able to clap your hands and the echo of the clap would just be eerie and haunting.     Breathing it all in physically and metaphorically was once in lifetime. What topped it all off was that last night of the camping trip. Around the campfire and stuff, playing campfire games and ghost stories. But when we walked back to the tents, the starry night really blew me away. The amount of stars that just come out when the city lights are not polluting really is one of the most beautiful things imaginable.     For myself, i had gone to bed, but my teacher had told us that when he stayed out longer to enjoy it, he had witness a sight flash across the night sky. He reckened it was a mini aurora. In a way, i sort of regret missing seeing it, but i already had my share of the carnival of light.

1219^NR^O^activity4^The type of sounds that I would hear are birds chirping flies buzzing, and cars going by from time to time. When the wind would blow I can hear the leaves rustling in the trees. I would also hear kids playing and adults talking. I would see clear skies with few clouds, moving from one end of the sky to the other. I would see birds flying around up high and insects feeding from the plants. I would see squirrels plying in the trees and on fences. I would see the tree swaying with the wind. I feel relaxed, and warmth from the sun. The deck underneath me is hard and hot in areas that aren’t shaded. I noticed the smell of burgers on the bbq next door.

Every morning, or more often afternoon, we would wake up, look out to a perfect sunny day. All sorts of tropical plants and animals surrounded the building. The inside of the room had a very distinct smell- not bad, but not great- that i can still smell everytime i think about it. the colours were plain, and sort of an old decor surrounded us. Little technology provided a sense of relief from the more modern, welathy society we were used to.

The sky was blue, clear, and electric.  The wind would blow gently and kick up some snow .  We usually got to the hill early, so there weren\'t many people around.  As I skied down the hill, the cold air rushed by my face, and i could feel the frost gathering on my snow suit.  The trees were snow covered, nearby houses were buried in piles of snow as well.

1432^CC^O^activity4^I go to my cottage every weekend for six months of the year. It\'s my favourite place, and although I prefer to be outside, I love being inside on cold fall days.  Every cold weekend we need a fire. Warm red and orange flames flicker in the fireplace, throwing their heat out into the main room. My dog\'s favourite place is in front of the fireplace, she always lies on her red and green dog bed, staring happily into the flames.   Generally, its really windy up there. The wind whistles around the corners of the building, sometimes is sounds like its shrieking and wailing. Any  leaves that are left, are blown off by this wind and twirl through the air only to land on the ground a little while later. The leaves are not a pretty as the used to be, instead of the vibrant reds, yellows, and oranges they are now all brown.   The lake out front is also affected by the wind, it roils and froths, crashing against our beach.   The sounds and sights I can see through my large picture window almost make me shiver. This is the part when i go sit beside my dog, in front of the warm fire.

The yard has many pine trees, tall and craggy, the way they grow in the foot hill and mountainous terrain.  A hammock hangs between two trees.  There are boxes of annuals, pansies, in particular, in colourful yellow and blue blooms.  The day is sunny, with high wisps of cloud in the air. Mountains with a little snow cover can be seen in the background. Three families are gathered round a long stretched out table in the yard, chatting, drinking wine or soft drinks, waiting for dinner to be cooked on the BBQ.  The beef and grilled vegetables give off a delicious smell.  It feels pleasantly warm - neither too hot nor too cold.  People are dressed in shorts and T-Shirts.  We are happy and content to be gathered together in such pleasant surroundings -- with no pressures but to enjoy the late afternoon and early evening.  We hope for the best in each other\'s lives.

It is usually smelling like inscents or sage because thats what helps my family relax. When the doors are shut its usually pretty quiet, if not i will here the sound of the dogs feet walking against the tile. I notice people walking by outside, and people walking by the door into the room which is clear. I notice people that notice me inside the room, and those that dont.

Sometimes i would take a break from work and go hide beside the bushes really early in the morning, just when people were beginning to arrive and set up their places on the sand.   It was very quiet sitting there. The sun would be beaming down onto the crisp morning, usually with a slight breeze. You could start to hear kids laughing and see them running to the water with their parents following soon after.  If you looked out onto the water you could not see to the other side, but there were usually 1 or 2 boats just in the distance. The shadow over the beach was so calming, slowly the sun would begin to fill the sky and warmth would fill the air. This all made me feel so lucky, so lucky to be able to take the time and enjoy nature and life. The sand was so soft under my foot, especially if the sun had been out for a while. And the smell of the lake would lume over the beach, as well as sunscreen and the smell of hot. I just wanted to lay down and fall asleep everytime i went to that place, but i knew i couldnt at the time because i had to go back to work. But in my head i knew that the following day i would be back there, sitting and watching, with a feeling of warmth and comfort.

1423^NR^O^activity4^The place that comes to mind for myself is a golf course.  More specifically it was when I played a course in San Diego called Torrey Pines.  It was a beautiful golf course and there were many things to hear, see, smell, etc.  It was pretty quiet there for the most part, as it is a golf course, but you still hear the random \"fore\" and obviously the chit-chat and jokes told amongst the foursome.  The wildlife was not very intense, however we did see a few deer on a couple of the holes.  The view on the otherhand was spectatcular.  The course is set right on the Pacific Ocean with several holes running directly along the cliffside into the water.  There were dozens of picturesque views overlooking the bay in San Diego, as well as boats, surfers, and the occasional whale or group of dolphins.  The colour scheme, as you could imagine, was consistent with the colour green, with many varrying shades and textures.  There was also the blue of the water, which you could not miss.  Lots of trees, whistling in the calm wind coming from the water and up the hillside.  I have never felt so good to be on a golf course, as it was almost a perfect day, in a beautiful spot.

The hairs on the back of my neck stand up, and an animalistic urge to hunt takes over.

I saw 3 move when I shined the light, I\'m sure there were more that I just couldn\'t see on the brick that my building is made out of.Apparently they were coming out at night, probably trying to escape the hot summer weather we were having. that\'s why I was finding so many in my second floor unit.

If I look out the window I see trees and a wooden swing, birds flying around and his cat playing in the grass. His bed is very soft and comfortable, the carpet is a little rough but his pillows are silky. It is usually very warm in the room, except in the mornings it is always very cold, always dry. I usually smell the candle his mom has put in the room and the smell of his cologne at times.

1408^CC^O^activity4^i am thinking about my boyfriend\'s bedroom.  it is cold because he has a big window that seems to let in a lot of outside air even though it was just replaced.  it is very dry in his house and my hands and skin always feel tight and chafing.  he is always on the computer so there is usually the sound of him typing and clicking with the mouse.  the room is pale green and the carpet is beige, very boring and impersonal.  it makes the room feel even colder.  the carpet is new and feels stiff and unpleasant under my feet.  but his bed and comforter are well worn in and very comfortable.  his dog will come in sometimes and just lie on the carpet or sniff around a bit.  the presence of the dog is always comforting and makes the room feel warmer.  the smell of the room varies depending on what food has been left there or whether or not he has done laundry.

It is room temperature (slightly warmer) and dry - but not cracked skin dry.  The scent would also be familiar.

1387^NR^O^activity4^My pleasant outdoor place is a nature walk through a rainforest. Whenever I go their it is always sunny and perfect conditions to go out for a walk and anything else you can do in the forest. Somethings if their is a strong wind, you can hear the trees and plants bend. If I happen to pass by anyone, I usually give them a smile and they respond to it with either a smile back or a friendly hello. Sometimes I see some animals like rabbits or squarrels zip by me. The smell of the forest is a pleasent one...unless you happen to pass by a skunk! This is my pleasent outdoor place because when here I can relief myself of all the pressures of reality and just spend time with myself.

There are alot of soft textures, such as the carpet and my comforters and drapes, but there are also alot of hard smooth surfaces (closet doors, tables, dressers). It is mostly cold because of the large windows. There are alot of spicy scents from candles and incense

1451^NR^O^activity4^I am thinking about sitting by the pool in the Dominican Republic. The sounds I would hear would be the local music, an announcer trying to persuade people to join in water aerobics or other activities, and people around me talking and lauhghing. There was no sound from animals or weather, just people and music. I saw the bright colour of the pool. It was very blue, as was the sky. The surrounding palm trees were all green. There were the multi-colours of people\'s bathing suits, towels and drinks. Children and adults alike were moving around and swimming in the water - going in dry and emergine wet. The chair I sat on was somewhat hard, but the towel underneath me softened it. It was very, very hot. I could sometimes not stand the heat so I would have to go into the cold water every five minutes in order to stay cool. The air was pretty humid the majority of the time. I could smell the hotdogs, hamburgers and fries being made in the hut slightly down the beach. Overall, it was a very pleasant experience.

1244^CC^O^activity4^The indoor place that I\'m thinking of is the home that I lived in when I stayed in the Dominican Republic.  The sounds I would hear there would be dogs barking, chickens fighting, the children outside playing with the skipping rope we gave them.  I could hear the mother we were living with cooking us different meals, the grandparents speaking in rapid spanish.  I could see the mismatched furniture that the family had acquired throughout their life, crowding the house.  There were colours both dull and vibrant.  Some homes were painted in bright colours, while others were faded out.  You could see the cars driving around outside, though the family I stayed with couldn\'t afford one.  There were plenty of bicycles that people used for their transportation within the town.  While I was there, it felt like everything was a shock to the system.  Everything was so different that my eyes couldn\'t take in enough.  There were so many different textures; the gravel that the children played on in their bare feet, the sand at the beach nearby, the coral in the ocean.  It was always warm and humid there.  There were street vendors everywhere, selling all different kinds of food that could be smelled from miles away.

I have my eyes closed under my sunglasses as I take in the sound of the waves brushing up on the shore and I can hear the birds flying over head. I can hear bicycle horns and people walking their dogs. People are talking and laughing. You can hear people splashing around in the cool water as children run on the beach building castles and playing games. I take a sip of my water and it cools my whole body as my toes dig into the hot sand. The breeze is warm and soft and I can feel it in my hair. The people are happy and alive and I feel great just being there. The beach is my favorite place to be in the summer.

1386^CC^O^activity4^My aunt\'s apartment in Egypt is on the third floor of the building yet you can still hear the sounds of the busy streets; people talking, joking around, or arguing over business, a man yelling out to the people on the streets that he is selling lemons, or fruit as his donkies bray while pulling the cart holding the food. You can hear the small convienient store and hair-salon blasting different arabic music even though they\'re right across from each other in the narrow alley way. The inside of the building is, incredibly, quiet. My aunt cooks in the kitech which is at the most 15 steps away from the living room in which I usually lounge. My brothers and cousins would be playing soccer in the streets right under the balcony so they\'re part of the outside noise. The television would be on, but they only have three channels which consist of a newsbroadcaster, a talk show channel, and a movie channel. The inside of the living room is very colourful. Large, elegant couches stretch out across adjacent walls right across from the television in the corner. The dining table takes up the other half of the room, with the doors to the balcony acting as a divider. The walls are a redish/burgandy colour, the second door to the house is beige. The floor is covered with egyptian patterned rugs that are all sorts of different colours yet are put together in a way that still makes them look good. The couches which are red with patterns of green and other colours that I can\'t quite remember. The couch is framed in gold coloured beautifully carved metal. The table is mahogany--don\'t know if I spelled that right. And you can see the enterance hall from the open whole in the wall connecting the living room to the rest of the house. Things there are calm, but vibrant. The coushions of the couches are made of plastic, so my aunt covers them with a white sheet that has 2 seperate red threads to fit over the gold frames. The room is quite warm, but, it\'s in Egypt so thats not a big surprise. And if it weren\'t for the 3 fans around, it would be extremely dry. There isn\'t really a scent, unless my aunt is cooking, but you can hardly smell it because she keeps the large windows opened in the small kitchen across the hallway. Strangely enough, despite the dense population, the air smells fairly clean.

1101^NR^O^activity4^The most pleasant outdoor place I can think of right now that is absolutely exquisite and peaceful is a park near my house. I usually go there to think, or just relax. When I am in this place I am listening and watching everything taht is going on around me; however, while things are happening I am also deep in my thoughts. I would see trees moving by the wind, I would see people walking by with their children, or a friend; yet, I was just looking but not speculating. When i am not stressed and go to this place, that is when i can observe everything, without thinking too deeply into my own life. I would look at details n flowers and in people and what they were doing. I would wonder how their lives are, and I would basically just speculate every detail I see. My most favourite moments is just being able to sit back and watch nothing. Just to hear the wind and to watch the sky - its amazing.

Inside the heater the coals are extremely hot, a burning red colour.  Outside the window I can see the showers, which look distant and cold from where I am.  I can also see the heat rising off the heater.  I feel very relaxed and accomplished, the wood is has a grainy texture, almost soggy.  It is very warm in this room, I am in a sauna.

The sounds I heard there were water rushing into the shore, people talking and laughing, music, clinking glasses in celebration. The sights I saw were bold colours, lots of high contrast. Beautiful sparkling sand, fluid shaped architecture and design. There were a variety of different green plants. Staff ran all over the place to serve efficiently and people waiting at the bars. There were lots of people out in the water or pools and out on boats. There was yoga lessons in the middle of the area by the pool where you could watch everything and take it all in. Even more, there were volleyball tournaments on the beach, people coming to visit the restaurant raised off the water or to play tennis. There was also a clash of vintage and modern depending on the area we visited in Havana Cuba. It defined the tourists from the residents. It was always warm and a happy place. It was wet and dry because of the juxtaposition of sand and water. It smelled constantly like a bakery and the drinks were always fabulously fruity. The air was crisp when there was a breeze and due to the plants the air was fresh.

The carpet and couch I\'m sitting on are both brown. The walls are a light grey colour. The cats would also be running around, so I would see them too.   Because of the fire, the room would be very warm, I wouldn\'t need a blanket. The couch is soft, not stiff. The coffee table I have my feet on would be hard, but still comfortable to use as a foot-stool.  The scents I would smell may be fresh laundry, or the wood burning in the fireplace.

1463^NR^O^activity4^Twin Elm Rugby Park. The sounds that you would hear here would be the panting of exhausted players, the cheers of fans supporting their team, a grunt as a player goes in for a tackle, tears from an injury, and cheers from a win. Sometimes you hear dogs on neighbouring farms barking, and if you\'re lucky and it happens to storm on the day you play, you get wind, and rain and even thunder and lightning. There is also a train track nearby and sometimes you can hear a train pass. The people you would find there would be rugby players and their fans and parents. And because the field gets rented out to other teams, soccer, football, field hockey and ultimate teams play there as well. You would see luscious green grass if you are there in the summer, perhaps brownish grass in the spring or fall and snow of course in the winter. There is a gravel path to the main building with grey rocks. I assume it is the same all year round. The trees would change colour with the seasons like the grass. There are always lots of things to watch there, the grass blowing in the breeze, people running around, dogs running around, cars and tractors passing by, balls flying through the hear. The textures there are sharp pointy gravel, soft cushy grass, pavement for the cars on. Of course it all changes in the winter, sharp ice, soft snow. Everything feels amazing for it\'s own reason. Getting tackled onto the grass, or into a puddle feels hard and yet soft, wet too. It can be boiling hot or freezing cold depending on the weather and wet or dry depending on the weather. My favourite is 21 degrees and sunny.The best smells there are clean fresh air, sweat, and freshly cut grass. I wish it wasn\'t winter.

Normally in this room I am lying down on the couch watching TV or talking to someone in my family. The sounds I would probably hear would be the TV, family members talking in the room and possibly someone cooking something in the kitchen. The couch itself is red leather, and kind of bulky. To it\'s left is a small table with a lamp on it, to it\'s right are two chairs and a standing light. The only texture I would feel would be the leather couch, which would probably feel smooth and cold. It would be fairly cold in the room, since my parents are trying to save money on electricity, and it would be dry. The only scents in the room would be coming from the kitchen which is connected to it, and would probably smell of cookies or burnt pasta.

The sounds were the main stimulus, as the sounds of the slot machines and of people were a great thing to listen to, and for weeks after my trip I would still hear the sounds of the slot machines in the back of my mind. It smelt very clean and the hotels all smells somewhat like chlorine which is a good smell in small amounts. It was very hot and dry there, and it was comfortable because you could move into the hotel which was well air conditioned or lay by the pool and enjoy the heat. Overall, it was a very lively place.

The lighting is soft and warm which creates a cozy feeling as if candles were always burning... and indeed there are candles on each small table. There are curtains that create small half-rooms form small corners. It always smells like incense and a pleasant mixture of exotic teas. As for the sounds in this place.. one can usually hear people speaking in wispers or laughing softly, the sound of water boiling, the waiters speaking in their home language and soft arabic music as background to it all.  The small tables, of smooth polished and elaborate woodwork, are surrounded by low sofas and colourful cushions.

1172^CC^O^activity4^A pleasent indoor place that comes to mind is my hotel room  at ElCozumelano in Mexico. I remember lying on the bed with the windows open, hearing the waves hitting the beach, the call of birds, the faint noise of people laughing and talking, some cheesy music that the hotel played ovver and over, every now and then the sound of a plane or helicopter or boat. The airconditioner would hum to life whenever it detected the room getting to warm. Sometimes I could hear people passing in the hallway, or the sound of the maid and her trolley rattling by.  The predominant colour of the room was a beige cream white. There were brightly coloured paintings and sketchs on the wall. Light streamed in from outside and all i had to do was turn my head and i could see the brilliant blue of the sky meet the blue green of the ocean. The top covering for the bed was kind of rough but the sheets were smooth and cool. The tile\'s were always chilled, most often they were dry but sometimes after returning from the beach or after getting out of the shower they became damp. Also after the maid finished mopping the tiles were slick and somewhat sticky with solvent. If at any point it began to get to warm the air conditioner would kick in and fix that problem, by keeping the windows open we kept from getting chilled by letting in the strong warm breeze. The breeze also carried the salty smell of the ocean in, around meal times the smell of food would waft upwards as well.

I see clear blue water, where coral, fish and rocks are evident. Sitting on the beach i see other people basking in the sun, playing frisbee, volleyball and all sorts of other games. With this i hear playful talking, along with the soothing sound of the wind coming off the warm ocean. The sand in the sun is very hot, but in the shade is very nice and almost feels soft. The breeze off the ocean is cool, which helps counter the suns radiant heat. I smell fruity drinks coming from the bar nearby. Along with the refreshing scent of the ocean breeze.

What i usually watch in the living room would be the tv but the colours and shapes in the living room is a a mix of green and blue with many things shaped as squares and rectangles. The things moving and changing would be on the tv or one of my family members leaving the room. Majority of the time the living room is a warm place, but not dry.

If its windy, the many trees are always blowing their leaves, and the birch trees that hang over the water swing dangerously. Rain is extremely loud when it happens, as it hits the roof and deck. Most of the time I am at my cottage there it is relatively warm, and the air has a fresh smell to it. There is no city smog, or exhaust from cars or buses. In fact, since it is on an island, there are no cars at all. The smell of wood burning is quite prevalent at night as we have campfires. The smell of fresh cut grass is also a regualr smell as well. The texture of the water is quite smooth, and the feel of the ground on my feet hurts at the beginning of the summer, but by the end i can confidently run around with no shoes on.

Browns and deep reds and dark blues... and they look beautiful against the contrast of the snow covered Alps outside the huge windows surrounding the rooms.   It smells like winter and breakfast.

Everyone has their fire places going, and you can hear crackling inside all of the rooms when people are home and have their doors open.  My bed has the best fuzzy blanket. I took it the second we all called beds, annnd I have no regrets about it.

My room is a beige colour with a patterned wallpaper on one wall. When I\'m in my room I feel very relaxed and calm. The textures in my room are smooth and soft, like my carpet and my duvet. It\'s nice and warm in my room and it would probably smell like my perfume.

Palm trees surrounding me. The sun is shining brightly tanning all of our skins. There are birds everywhere. Crabs making their way across the sand. Dolphins jumping across the ocean horizon. The sand is so hot that you have to put a towel down to be able to lie on it. They day goes by so slowly because your able to take in the whole environment around you. I can smell the salt of the ocean. Behind me are coconut trees and fallen coconuts on the ground. The white sand and crystal clear ocean go perfectly together.

The scent of flowers and wood brought back memories of me as a child. The decor especially was what made me think of her bathroom. It was mostly white with celing tiles of different dutch animations. The bathroom had a window that allowed me to look at all the dutch people in the streets. All I could here was people talking outside and the shower pouring.

When I wasn\'t listening to music, I would lay there and listen to the waves, the cool breeze against the palm trees, and the people walking by. The sand was slightly white, the water was a nice dark blue, the trees and grass were dark green and the sky was a beautiful light blue almost everyday.  I could feel the scorching sun all day and also smell the salt from the ocean.

It was our grade 12 trip and 30 of us went, I was with people I actually liked and people that actually liked me. It was raining almost every day, but we still had a great time. Trevi fountain is in the middle of a shopping square I guess it could be called. There were ice cream (gelato) shops, souvenirs, and many people walking about. It was quite chilly when we went, but everyone is smiling in all the pictures so we liked it none the less. The fountain is really nice, and just looking at it is relaxing, my friend and I just stared at it as we ate our gelato. When we finished we threw some coins into the fountain after making a wish. There is a lot of stone and many very nice sculptures. The people there are friendly, but mind their own business, so you aren\'t disturbed on your trip. It\'s nice to be there, a beatuiful city (Rome) and with great friends, I would go back anyday. There a few sounds, people walking, talking and laughing, caches opening and closing,the sound of the water from the fountain running and the sound of cameras going off. And then the sound of our group leader\'s voice calling us over as we head to our next destination.

I remember just hanging out at the hotel with my family and relatives just talking about the good old times and just laughing. Now I know this activity is asking to describe an indoor place,, but the only place I could think of was being on the beach. It\'s the only thing that comes to mind. Although I did hang out on the hotel balcony as often as I could during sunset times. The sound of the waves just made me forget everything, and for once I was thinking about anything, there wasn\'t a care in the world except the sun setting and the waves crashing.

The wind makes the sound of the wind chime ring. You can hear the leaves in the tree rustling. There isn\'t very many people out and about. When there is they are quiet enough to go without noticing. Sometimes the sound of a boat engine goes against the water. The colour of the water seems to change colour from light green to a blackish colour in the night. The clouds darken things and make the water look dark and ominous. Things seem to slither. There are water snakes sometimes. The shapes of the waves come in and out. The clouds move across the sky. The water feels cold. It\'s freezing at first but after awhile your body warms to it. There are warm spots and cold spots in the water. Pockets of different temperatures. The grass feels cool and the sand sticks to my toes. Inside the sheets feel soft and inviting. It\'s warm underneath the covers. My wet hair seems to take forever to dry. It chills me as it lies limp against my shoulders. You can smell the rain in the air. Or the smell of smoke from the bbq. The smell from my cigerette is enough to block out all but the strongest scents.

You could hear the water splashing against the rocks. There was a steady buzz of voices from all the tourists. Occasionally a child\'s shriek or giggle would rise above the noise. The air was humid but the water cooled you off. Even when you came out of the water all you could taste was the salt.

1338^CC^O^activity4^A nice indoor place I can think of is a beach house in Myrtle Beach. I wen tthere last summer on a vacation with my girlfriends family. It was a house right along the beach, and every morning the sun would rise and you could see the sun shining over the ocean. Inside the house was fairly large, 5 bedrooms, a large livingroom, a dining room and kitchen. I remember the peace adn quiet in the house during the day, just sitting around relaxing or at night when going to sleep. There were lots of visual sensory elements such as seeing everyone in the house being so happy to be away from the stress of everyday life, and lying on the couch with my girlfrind watching TV. The main sounds that I remember were the conversations over dinner where everyone seemed so happy and relaxed to be away from home. It was a very warm climate there, and sometimes too humid, but most days it was nice enough weather just to sit around the house and not feel too hot. I don\'t recall many scents from around the house, only the smell of the ocean several feet away while sitting on the patio outside.

The sound of the water, the waves and as the water laps onto the shore. This sound is peaceful to me and very relaxing. The sound of many different birds can be heard. They each sing a different tune and this is relaxing and uplifting at the same time. Their songs are upbeat and chipper. Colors range from various ranges of green, blues and browns. In April the cherry trees are in full bloom and their pink color blends in creating a work of art. Except for the winter, in is mostly warm and dry. Winters are wet but still not very cold.

1496^CC^O^activity4^My high school drama class.  When I was 15 in my drama class, every other friday or so we would have guided meditation/relaxation.  On those days I would feel very relaxed, as the usual busyness of the day was interrupted with calm, and I could spend an approximate hour focussing on my breath, leaving me more attentive to my consciousness and breath for the remainder of the day.  I remember I would always feel warmer as muscles relaxed and breath slowed down.  I can remember feeling the soft brush of a comfortable knit sweater rubbing against my skin as my lungs inflated and deflated.  Everything in that room was painted black, and as the room filled with silence, one could hear noises from the distant corridor as students passed by in the middle of class time. I also remember tuning in to the sounds of vehicles passing by on the street just outside of the door; a fluctuating low hum.  As we delved further into meditation, my awareness state would like that of reaching sleep.  One is generally aware of the surrounding movements, sounds, and smells, but hears them as if it is distantly, as if one were removed from the instruments of the sense and was merely an observer, unattached to the ongoings.  When someone nearby moved, you could feel a minor current of air displacing, and the coolness would sweep and feel cleansing in the refreshed and relaxed state.  After it was over, eyes would open and take in the visual stimuli again, friends, teacher, the black walls, floor, and ceiling.  I would feel centered, and my hands which were normally cold, would be warm and feel revitalized.  I would continue the rest of my day at a very relaxed, cautious, almost turtle pace, as I was more aware of my environment and every occurence as I carried on with my day.

I\'m not sure if it\'s a trend there, but the hostel had no central heating, just a fireplace in the common room. Outdoor temperatures were around 5-10 degrees Celsius. Now, there was no insulation, the room had very high ceilings, and huge windows that did not close properly, so it was VERY cold during the day and night. That was why the bed was so comfortable. It was a wooden bunk bed, I was on the bottom. So, it was dark, even in the daytime and the blankets were soft fleece. I had a green one and a pink one.  The bed was soft, but just firm enough to support my back.  Mmmmmm I would often sleep thorough the day and wake up in the afternoon because the bed was so comfortable.  Also because it was so cold that I did not want to get out of bed in the morning.  The floor in the bedroom was wooden and creaky, so anytime anyone got up to use the bathroom in the night or got up in the morning, or when the cleaner came in to change the bedclothes, there were a lot of creaking footsteps.  There were about 5 bunk beds in that room, so I shared it with about 9 other people. Because of the windows, the daylight would always come in the room in the morning, reflecting off of the white sheets and walls, making the room very bright. It was nice, but if I wanted to sleep, I just turned to face the wall, and, because I was on the bottom bunk, I would be able to get some darkness. The colors of the room were nice. The floor was a dark wood, like ebony or some stained wood, and very old, so the floorboards weren\'t all level. The walls were white, as were the sheets on the beds. But the blankets over the sheets were pink, green, blue, grey, red, etc. Bright colors.  The bunk beds themselves were also wooden, the same color as the floor. This bed was, honestly, one of the two most comfortable beds I have ever slept in.

1429^NR^O^activity4^A pleasant place in the outdoors for me would have to be at the camp I work at in the summer. It\'s always beautiful out, even when it\'s raining. It\'s very green, and warm. It smells like dirt sometimes, and you can even taste it when it\'s being blown by the wind- it\'s slightly gross, but you can\'t do much about it. You can hear all types of animals and insects- raccoons, squirrels, crickets, etc. When it rains, you can hear it very loudly on the tops on the roofs, and in the puddles its\' created. When it\'s windy- all you can hear is the trees and the bugs buzzing around your head. You can hear birds- from chickadees to eagles. There is a lot of wood everywhere, trees, buildings etc. The textures are bark-like, or very defined, like grass, or spruce tree leaves. It smells wet sometimes because of the rain, and other times it smells like skunk, or whatever animal may have just been offended.    it\'s beautiful.

1272^CC^O^activity4^I like to sleep in my bed. It is comfy and nice and warm. It is quiet when i want it to be.... and when i want to listen to music, i just turn on my music and it is exactly what i wanted to hear. The walls are blue and it seems very relaxing. It smells a lot like my girlfriend\'s perfume and i like that smell a lot. The room is a bit messy but that is just the way i like it.

1396^CC^O^activity4^Since it is getting closer to going home for the break, I imagine myself in my room at home. The clean walls and smells, hardwood floor, the lighting, all my stuff is there. I can hear my family moving around in there daily lives.    I can see my grey painted walls, the green and tan desk, the blinking router, and my comfy bed! So much better than my res bed, I like waking up each morning to the sun filtering through my white curtains.

1492^CC^O^activity4^i find the most pleasant place i can go, to be my bedroom. this is because it has all of my personal belongings in it, and i got to chose how i wanted to decorate it. i set it up in a way that would make me feel cozy. i made sure to have a very comfortable bed, because i enjoy lying in bed and thinking. when relaxing in my room, i usually have music or the t.v on in the background. this is because i feel more at ease when i have noise going on in the background. i also have a pet bunny, and his cage is at the foot of my bed. i can usually hear him eating his food, or hopping around his cage, and sometimes even chewing on his cage. i have come accustom to hearing my bunny move around. sometimes in my room, i can hear my roomate, humming a tune, or i can hear her t.v, or even just her walking around. the walls in my room are pretty bland, because i live in an apartment, and didn\'t want to have to repaint when i left. i have pictures hung on the walls, and picture frames. my bed is very colourful,and really high up off the ground. the comforter is silk and looks very regal. the sheets are extremely soft, and offset the colours of my comforter. i also have a down feather blanket underneath my comfortor. i like the feeling of the down because its heavy, and keeps me really warm. warmth is key, in my room because i get cold very easily. it doesnt really smell like anything in my room, i\'ve never really been a fan of crazy scents or something. i like that its just normal. if anything i open the window sometimes to get fresh air. thats about it.

I could be finishing this term paper on a beach instead of in cold Ottawa.  This beach would be very warm and bright.  The textures of sand would fill my sandells when I walked.  It would be a continuous cycle of wet and dry - cooling off in the water from baking under the southern sun.  The colours would be a bright baby blue sky, reflecting the deep blue ocean.  Sand would be an off white.  Being in this evvironment while reading a book and drinking a cold drink would be perfect.

1504^CC^O^activity4^I\'m in the room I stayed in, in Scotland. It\'s small, but cozy and smells clean, but has a scent reminiscent of childhood--somewhat spicy and old, like my grandpa\'s home. It\'s slightly chilly from the mist rolling over the highlands, but we\'re kept warm by the thick, heavy blankets that cover the beds. It\'s a quiet place, except for the creaks in the floor (as it was an old house), which added to the atmosphere. The pillows were soft and plaid. The bathroom, was chiller than the rest of the room, as the flooring was much colder. A crow awoke me in the morning, which also enhanced the atmosphere of the place. The feelings of the place are forever etched in my mind, as it was so beautiful and ancient.

1118^CC^O^activity4^     The place that I am thinking about is my boyfriend\'s basement.       I feel really content there in the dark on his big comfy couches in his basement... that is, when we are getting along.       It\'s also relaxing for me because I don\'t have to deal with the stress of my own house where everyone is running around doing things, especially my Mom.       The sounds I would hear there is a slight hum of the computer... mabye the crackling of the fireplace... his parents/sister in the distance, although that doesn\'t bother me because generally they speak pretty softly during these times unlike my own family.       I would see the soft warm shades of his furniture and rugs with the bright glow coming from the TV.       Things feel soft like the leather couch and blankets... its also less stressful there because things are tastefully kept to a minimum, even with the moving boxes all around.      It is a little bit cold but the blanket is keeping me warm, of course, it is dry.      And it smells clean.

1490^CC^O^activity4^The place I pick is somewhere I used to go back in my hometown. This area was a large conservation park not too far from my home. I used to go there and lay in the tall grass by the stream and think or just relax with my friends. I would hear the river, bugs and the grass moving in the breeze. It would smell so fresh because of all the plants, grass and flowers. The traffic of a nearby road could be heard in the distance. It felt very calm there. I went at any time of year, summer it would be warm, winter it would be cold and wet. It was fun to go tobogganing down a huge hill nearby. It never had anybody in it. There was a small graveyard nearby where only a few visitors came.

1495^NR^O^activity4^in 2006 i went to Paris. It has always been my dream to go see the eiffel tower. When i finally got there, it was much better then i had ever anticiapted. It was a very breezy day and it was extremely packed. atleats a thousand people were all lining up to be able to take the elevator up to the highest point of the tower. I ended up taking the stairs because it was much cheaper and the line was much shorter. so as i went there and i saw the landscape around me it was absoluetly breath taking. the grass was nice and green the sun was shining but not enough to really make you hot. the birds were all around the sky and flying above the people. People around were taking in many different languages. in awe and amazement at how beautiful it is. There was so many things to see that you wouldnt expect. there was a mini resteraunt and the smell of food was not at all apparent. You coudlnt really smell anythng but breath in the air. it was absoutley gorgeuous and something that i think about almost everyday.

I remember it was damp and warm - coming from Alberta, I\'m not used to that much humidity. I think it smelled fresh, like spring, and you could hear some birds. I remember standing in the gazebo, in motorcycle gear. The floor and roof and railings were all old treated wood. The sky wasn\'t exactly blue outside, but it was cast over, and it had rained earlier. I took off my helmet and put it on the ground, and stood there for a while, just watching the water trickling by (the gazebo was in the middle of a water garden), lily pads floating on top.

1485^NR^O^activity4^I\'m from Calgary originally and ski is a common winter activity, because of Calgary\'s close proximity to the mountains.  And after a long day of skiing I usually go to the hot springs by Banff.  That is always a place I look forward to when ever I\'m in the mountains back home.    The feeling is great, freezing cold mountain air, blowing snow all around, and the warm of the hot springs on my skin.  Its so nice sitting there enjoying the company of friends and/or family.  It\'s pleasing to me socially and relaxing to my body.    If you get out of the hot water, your body stays warm for a bit, and the feeling of cold air blowing on you is rejuvenating.  But if you stay in the water you\'ll never get cold.  The water is cleaned so it doesn\'t smell like sulfur, which is a good thing.  There are generally always a lot of people there, but its nice sometimes to sit there and watch other people enjoy the hot springs.  The hot springs over look Rundle Mountain and the Banff area.  The building nicely resemble a natural stone and wooden structure, typical of most building in that area.  That is the most pleasant spot I would want to be right now.

1513^NR^O^activity4^One of my favorite places is our family cottage, I have been going there my whole life and the smell had never changed. We are surrounded by big trees that eventually block the sun on the deck; I know its 4pm when there is no more sun at that certain spot on the deck. We are right on the water so to just sit there on the deck listen to the sound of the waves come in when I boat in the distance go by is so relaxing, at night you hear all sorts of bugs and animals, never sure what type of either but it sounds amazing. At night you also hear the bats on the water just flying by. There is no better sleep in the world then at the cottage,it might be humid and damp but  the sound of the blowing trees in the wind at night and smell of fresh air or even the sound of rain on the trees a hot summer night are so relaxing. We do go to the cottage are year, as much as the summer is fun and beautiful with the hot sun with the swimming, which is one of my favorite things to do the feeling nice lake water leaves on your skin is amazing, nothing beats the trees in the fall and in the winter sitting in the cottage with the wood stove on and watching the big white snowflakes come down on the almost frozen water is breath taking. The 4 cottages next to ours is all family, it’s one of the only times I actually see any of them is up at the cottage. Going up there for 26 years i still don\'t see a huge change, the level of the water has come up and some trees are getting old, but it still have the same feeling and smells that remind me of every summer up there.

1498^CC^O^activity4^This place would have to be the room i was in when i was in Cuba on vacation. It was a small room on the second floor and you could hear a lot of music and people chattering outside (resort). There were 3 large beds in the room, a TV, bathroom, a mini fridge and lamp stands. The room was pained white i believe, cant really remember. The room felt very cold because of the AC. You would be outside and when you came in the room you felt so relaxed because of the extreme heat outside and the cold air in the room.

1486^CC^O^activity4^I am sitting in the fernie ski lodge. People are talking, many people are talking. like a food court in a shopping mall. everything from children laughing and complaining, to adults talking about past times and present experiences on the hill. the only machine that can be heard is the cash register from the caffiteria opening and closing with a ring!i see my friends right in front of me, but besides them, i see children on their first day of ski or snowboard lessons, i also see peoples moms waiting for their kids to come in for a quick hot chocolate break. i also see many people, many from europe, and many from other places around the world. i also see huge lineups at the cafeteria. looking outside i can see the mountain and i eye up the trails i will soon be taking, scouting out the various routes. i see many bright colors on peoples jackets, but i also see many many people with earth toned colors on their winterware. i see many shapes, but by far i see peoples helmets (a circle or sphere) the most. people are constantly moving and changing places while others take their places. i feel the texture of my gloves and jacket and the ice that has built up under my jacket. i also feel the textures of the food and the table i am sitting at. the food is warm and moist, the snow is cold and wet. the scent of overpriced hamburgers and fries fills the air, but it is overpowered with an amazing smell of warmed winter air that is constantly being refreshed by the neverending opening and closing of the doors to the outside.

1460^CC^O^activity4^I am going to talk about the last vacation, on the north coast in egypt. The types of sounds you hear there are the sounds of the bird\'s singing at the early morning. In the morning when i used to go walk on the sea bank i would lestin to the movement of waves of the blue sea. When i go back to the chalet i would hear the sound of the soft and slow music coming from the stero system as well as the noises of the near by naighbours chatting while eating breakfast. However, the most recognizable sceant, was the sean of the beautiful blue sea as the sun rises and have a yellow deflection on the water. finally, the weather was mostly warm, since it was during the summer time.

1453^NR^O^activity4^When I was younger, I remember always going to the beach neaby my house. I used to lay on the sand by the water for hours and just listen to the waves. I remember loving the sights...dark green/blue waters seemed to stretch on forever before being able to just make out the trees and cottages on the other side. Picnic tables littered the park area just behind the sand. Sand stretched in a wide expanse for children to build sand castles and for people to play volleyball. The sounds were relaxing. Hearing the gulls and waves crashing against the sand was very conforting for me and there were always other children running around and playing in the water. There was plenty of green, the parks, the grass, trees, and water. The sand felt gritty beneathe my bare feet and the water felt refreshing and cool against the summer heat.

The room is always fairly warm, but we would open the window and let a cool breeze in which is just above her bed.  There wouldn\'t really be anything noted sounds, except for the TV and maybe cars pulling into the court, which seemed to happen a lot at night.  And the scent of her room is veyr important to me because it reminds me of her and her house.  All in all, its a very relaxing place for us to chill.

It has a very specific smell, one that will always remind me of the happy times had there.  You could hear splashing in the pool, cars pulling up to their parking spot, lots of birds, a fountain in a pond and always lots of laughter.  Inside the rooms, I could see lots of neutral colours as well as regular shapes and textures that you find within a bedroom, living room and kitchen.  It is very warm outside, but just the perfect temperature inside of the hotel.  It is damp due to the humidity.

Occasionally a water heater will kick in with a clicking noise. There are wood textures and white doors. It would be warm and humind. You would be able to smell cooking from the kitchen if the door is open, the outside air if the window is open and maybe the faint smell of cleaning chemicals.

1401^NR^O^activity4^When I was going to the university of toronto in Missisauga there was this trail right across the street from our residence. I used to go walking there a lot for exercise and to clear my head. It was a wide dirt path with a lot of large trees. There wasn\'t too much noise except when someone would come along with their dog or on their own, or when squirrels would be around. Im sure the trees made noise but i mostly remember walking there in the middle of winter when there was less wind. it was usually wet because the temperature would vary so much and i remember being very cold because i didnt have a decent winter coat. but i still liked going there, almost daily. i nwould bring my ipod so certain songs that i listened to there still remind me of those walks. there\'s the sent of winter which is this metalic smell and the scent of mud and dirt. i dont remember specific smells as much as i do images. i used to walk the trail as far as i could east right into the city and these very upscale neighbourhoods. one day i was walking and i turned to see a baby deer or faun just standing there, he couldnt have been more then a few feet away from me. he had an interesting texture. my dad is a hunter so ive seen lots of deer in hunting videos, magazines and here in ottawa but this one had a really thick auburn coloured coat. it looked so warm. and his tail was a lot longer then i think i expected it to be. we stood there looking at each other for a long time before i continued on my way.

There would be a mixture of animal sounds, mostly birds communicating with each other in a loud, collaboration of whistles. The trees would be very tall, reaching up into the sky. There would be a tarp of leafs above, with the sun just peaking through to the ground every couple of steps I would take.

1499^NR^O^activity4^today i went to work, on the way the roads were icy and slippery. it was a dangerous ride there, i didnt get to pay much attention to anything other than the roads and other cars. after work i went to the hospital to visit a friend. he is dying from cancer, the doctors said that he has a day or two left to live. i remember staring at him on his bed, and then i looked outside to the dark night the room he was in was in the Rogers house in cheo, he had such a beautiful view of the snow and christmas lights, you would never realize you were in a dying mans room from this view. it reminded me how alone we all are but at the same time it reminded me that i am alive, and i will be able to go outside and play and touch and feel the snow, and he will never get to enjoy this view, he will never get to leave his bed, to go outside to touch and play in the snow, to kick a soccerball or play basketball. he can never get sun tanned nor feel the cold pool water on a hot summer day. his days are limited and that makes me sad. but it also makes me feel greatful, which makes me feel guilty because it makes me feel selfish even though i know i have every right to feel greatful at a time like this. and that at times like this the only thing you can do is pray for God to help the sick and protect ourselves. it reminds me of a few months back when my grandpa was dying from cancer in august, he passed away the day after the first day of school. and on the first week of school i could barely pay attention in class, i would stare outside, to nothing really, but just think about every plan he made with me. he promised he would get better and that we could travel to the middle  east together, that he would be better way before april so that i would be done for the summer and that he would be well enough to travel, not knowing that less than three weeks later he would take his last breath, breaking every promise to travel with me, and every promise that he would get better. and now as i watch my friend go through the same situation, i know not to get my hopes up about promises of getting better but only to give the poor boy hope that he will last as long as he fights, to get him to fight for his last dying breath. now theres nothing left to do but wait for the same fate, twice in 4 months, two important people in my lives were snatched away by this devil called cancer and i could only wish that i had those powers that the prisoner in the movie Green Mile had where i could just take away their pain and diseases. but i cant and i am just a normal person, all i can do is pray now and mourn later.  lifes not fair like this.

We were the last house on the street and not to far from a small creek that flowed into a cattail filled swamp. The frogs would croak all night making different sounds that would echo across the field. It was a very peaceful sound.

1537^NR^O^activity4^When I went to botanical gardens over the summer there were numerous sensations to be experienced. I heard the sound of trees moving in the wind which brought a very calm sound to my ears and made me want to fall asleep. There were animals like squirrels and chipmunks all around the park which could be heard when climbing up trees or running through the grass. People were walking around chatting about the amazing types of plants. Most of the plants were green because it was summer, but there were different textures and tastes of the plants, especially in the garden for the blind. Some of the plants were fuzzy, others were rough, some were thick. Many of the plants smelled sweet, and the air felt very fresh to be surrounded by so many plants. It was warm for most of the day, but it began to rain later in the afternoon. however, there were so many plants indoors that it did not bother me. Also, there was an insectarium. The sensations that I experienced in the park were mostly of calm, interest, satisfaction and rejuvenation from being in a natural setting that was close, yet removed from the city.

What joy when I saw my snowdrops blooming - how strong they are to have survived all that heavy snow on top of them - they give me hope, I love snowdrops.    I fed the birds , I love watching the birds in the garden.  Whilst I filled the bird feeders the birds were sitting in the trees watching me and twittering away.  This makes me feel good, I feel as if I am doing good.  I think perhaps Spring is coming soon.

I love watching the steam rising off the lake, mimicing the steam rising from my coffee mug and the still peacefulness that comes when very few people are awake or around and the sun is still not very high in the sky.

My dad spends a considerable amount of his time cooking in the kitchen, while my dog sits and watches.  The kitchen is where I go to visit family members or pat my dog.  There are usually rich smells emanating from the kitchen, so that my stomach begins to rumble if I am somewhere other than the kitchen.  When I go into the kitchen I am usually greeted with a medley of colours, in particular if my dad is in the middle of cooking.  For example, sometimes he will have different veggies spread all around the counter.  There are bright veggies (e.g., red peppers) and darker veggies (e.g., eggplant).  There are also foods of many different textures on my counter (e.g., smooth chocolate truffles vs.  hard crackers ).  Usually there are lots of sounds coming from the kitchen.  They vary from the sound of a blender to the sound of veggies being chopped on a cutting board.  My kitchen is one of the warmest places in our home.

As I walk along the promenade, I have the sea on my right and parklands and the town on my left. I can smell the salt spray. The sea is rolling gently. The hovercraft taking people too and from the Isle of Wight is a constant. The sun is shinning, a gentle breeze blows, and people are walking along the pebble shore, laughing and happy. The parklands are full of people at recreation. Henry VIII\'s historic Southsea Castle dominates, as does Clarence Pier and the Fun Fair. Everyone is enjoying themselves. I feel content and happy to be reconnecting with the place of my birth and childhood; knowing that I have the freedom of choice to go wherever I please.

1565^NR^O^activity4^Im thinking about the farm where my grandparents live. My mum and her 5 brothers and 1 sister grew up there. It is always so quiet out there, with interjecting sounds from the utes and tractors, the dogs, insects, and sheep. It hardly ever rains, or is windy- mostly it is really still, and hence why it feels so quiet and peaceful. When there is wind the gum trees that surround the house rustle, and the wind makes howling noises sometimes when windows are left a little open, or down in the back hallway (its a pretty old house). My nan and pa live there full time, but they always have visits from friends and family. My uncle lives about 100m away in a house withhis wife and 3 young children. He runs the farm while my pa oversees it. When the kids are around it is of course a bit noisier. I love being out at the farm- the stillness and continued hotness, the smell of nan\'s kitchen, her perfume, pas aftershave, the wool in the shearing shed. Everything smells nice out there. I always feel safe out there as it is pretty isolated, and I love being with my family

1543^NR^O^activity4^I can hear the wind rustling through the wheat field all around me. If I lean down I\'m totally hidden by the golden ripe stalks of grain. Feels like my own secret hiding place. If I\'m really quiet for a while I can hear the small creatures like mice moving around. It\'s quite warm and dry.  I can also hear birds singing and in the distance cattle lowing and the occassional car passing by on the dirt road, leaving a streak of dust in its wake. The sky is very blue with a few puffy white clouds driting by. Every once in a while a breeze will come up and make the most amazing whispering sound in the grain. I can also smell the powdery scent of the wheat itself and the rich smell of the earth. The smell of recently mown hay is also in the air.

I can hear my chair squeaking a little as I rock in it. I hear the sound of the tea kettle whistling. It\'s warm from the heaters and from a blanket over me. The blanket is wool and scratchy. There don\'t seem to be any signs of life outside, maybe a lone bird or two. The sunlight is coming in through the windows and is warm on my face.

1601^NR^O^activity4^Until recently, I used to sleep outside during summer. This meant getting into my mozzie-proof tent as soon as the light faded, sometimes before.  One of the lovliest things was lying there in the silence as the air changed from day to night. The moisture and earthiness gradually rises and takes possession of the night and there is an aroma of living things.  During the day, the smells are pleasant enough, flowers and trees, animals and warmth and I enjoy these too. But there is something more intimate about sharing the way the night comes slowly to the senses.  If there is a wind, the trees hiss and whisper; night birds call and continue their constant forage for food.   Possums, hedgehogs and other creatures slink about looking for prey, or become prey; domestic animals take it all in their stride.  I often wonder what cows and sheep think when it becomes dark - do they go through life thinking that every 12 hours or so they lose their sight?!  No people intruded into this secret world of mine, very few even knew I was sleeping out and those who did thought I was eccentric (at best).    Colours all but disappear and everything becomes grey-blue if there is a moon. On what Maori call Tangaroa nights, all is black, no moon and few stars, so it is always quieter and deeper on these night.  Sometimes I\'d take a candle into the tent and read but the light caused moths to bombard the nylon and although they couldn\'t get in, the noise would distract me.  I\'d sleep out from November to May, at least, sometimes longer and by the time autumn arrived, the nights and mornings were quite chilly.  I was warm enough in my tent but the air around me was sharp and sweet and there was often mist on the grass when I emerged.  I miss sleeping outside very much, having a window open all night isn\'t the same.

1602^CC^O^activity4^My living room is usually quite quiet and very peaceful. There are no outside traffic noises although the faint sound of skytrain intrudes into my thoughts every 4 minutes or so.  The green of nature is present in my house plants, the best one being the tall Norfolk Pine that stands in one corner.  As it grows taller, its branches needs increasingly more space. The last vestiges of Christmas are evident in my two poinsetta plants.  I keep the temperature fairly warm; it feels cozier that way. A fleece wrap hangs over my sofa for use on colder evenings. If I feel a bit chilly, my first impulse is to do the easy thing, which is: crank up the thermostat.  On my antique blonde mahogany trunk/coffee table, I have a vanilla diffuser and a tin labelled \"Wild Thing\" with a musk scented candle within.

I sit at the \"just right\" table, perfect size and height for me.....I have a cup of wonderful chai tea latte at my side, my laptop computer open and in front of me.  People are there, but they are quiet and mannerly.  Being that it is in a family city, I can even let my purse sit there as I go to the counter as it is safe.....The smell of coffee is in the air.  Just the right amount of sunlight is coming through the high windows nearby.  I grabbed a few interesting looking books to peruse in case I take a few breaks during my work.  I work at that table for hours and hours, able to accomplishment my maximum goals of completing powerpoint presentations I have to give later this month in out of state locations.  The occasional and slight disruption of a child\'s gleeful utterance is not really disturbing, but a rather welcome pause in the intensive work I\'m involved with.  I am happy.

1632^CC^O^activity4^My bedroom is like my sanctuary - I feel relaxed and safe there. I like the colours in there - they make me feel peaceful and calm and comfortable. Sounds I often hear in my bedroom: the wind on the outside of the house; the baseboard heater turning on; the sump pump occasionally running in the basement directly below my bedroom; the fridge running or the washer/dryer going. (I find the sound of the dryer rather soothing actually!)Once in awhile there might be someone outside walking by making some noise (I\'m close the road/sidewalk); and cars in and out of the parking lot at the apartment next door.  The colours of my bedroom are primarily pink and brown, with some white/cream. I have a nice plush duvet on my bed with several pillows and a knitted afghan made for me by a family member. I have lots of beach-related items such as shells and sand (also in varying shades of pink and brown and in-between). I have some photos of the beach, and a framed picture of a horse that I drew myself several years ago. I also have many books that are favourites, and some that I haven\'t yet read (I love books), and some journals to write in.  It is usually warm here because I\'ll turn the heat up a little bit when I go in that room to relax or read or have a catnap. Otherwise it\'s turned down a bit during the night for sleeping.  Once in awhile it smells like my perfume in there, which is a soft scent - nothing strong.

1581^NR^O^activity4^The place I am thinking of is called Byron Bay. It is in Australia.  I am standing on the cliff face, near the lighthouse that is there.  On one side I can see an amazing beach that stretches on for miles.  There are hardly any people there as it is a weekday and it is kind of secluded.  On the other side is a bay.  It is smaller and well sheltered and there are more people there.  The sky is blue and cloudless.  The sea is clear and blue with a touch of green.  As I look out towards the horizon, it is hard to distinguish the sea from the sky.  The only sound I can hear is the sound of the ocean hitting the rocks way below me.  It is a warm day.  It is not too hot, but I can feel the warmth of summer approaching.  There is a slight wind bringing with it the smells of Australia - gum trees, sand, salt, native plants.

1657^NR^O^activity4^Coogee beach, there\'s a natural amphitheatre in the sandstone.  I like it because it has a good view of the crashing waves, gets a lot of strong wind, and even though there are people nearby most of them don\'t know it\'s there and can\'t see you, so you\'re undisturbed.  I go there often to write or relax.  The wind is fresh, salty, strong.  It smells of the sea.  The waves are loud.  Sometimes they send salty spray up onto your face.  They sound constant but irregular.  The clouds skim across the sky because you can see the horizon.  There\'s the constant sound of birds, usually seagulls as they fly around looking for food or fishing in the waves.  You don\'t hear other people, which is the best bit.  The sandstone feels a little warm, but everything else is cold and refreshing.  The sandstone is crumbling, eroding under the wind, so it feels gritty and grainy under your hands.  You feel sheltered, which is odd as you\'re facing the brunt of the weather.

There was this one little window and sunshine streamed in through the blinds all day and at night what with the highway, car\'s and truck\'s headlights would flash across the wall. The covering on the bed was a fuzzy pink and the walls themselves were either a beige or off white, I can\'t remember. The bed was the most comfortable I had ever slept in. It was at my father\'s and his new wife had got this deal on a special made bed that the people who had placed the order had changed their mind, so she got this amazing bed for a discount. It was in the room I slept in when I visited. The sheets were so soft, the room was never too cold or too hot. There was a flowery scent from the air freshener that was in the bathroom next door. Even if I couldn\'t sleep, I would lay in that bed wrapped in the blankets and be prefectly contented. Even with the highway sounds (which took awhile to get used too, that will always be the place where I was the most comfortable. How I miis that bed!!

It has relaxing alternative background music playing and there are the usual cafe sounds of coffee machines, plates, people talking, cash registers and eftpos machines etc.  the music isn\'t too loud which is good so people do not have to raise their voices to be heard.  There s just about every colour and shape to be seen, but the place generally has a cosy round-edged feel, with large sofas and round tables.  The general background colour is a yellow-gold, with th tables and chairs shades of tan and brown.  The walls and furishings do have bright colours, flowers in vases and pictures and glass mosaics to brighten the place and add interest.  The sofas are a bit too soft and are likely to sinlk a bit too deep when sat on.  They are nicely worn in corderoy-type fabric, and \"homey\".  The floors are cool tile, the tables clean varnished wood.  In the winter months there is a gas fire which adds to the warmth and cosy appeal.  Coffee is the overwhelming scent, but there are all kinds of food smells from the kitchen as well.

It\'s usually pretty quiet as I go in summer when the weathers nice. I can hear the birds, some rustling now and again. Sometimes theres other people aroundbut it\'s quite out of the way for most people, quite a trek to get there, often I\'m the only person there. Theres also a reservoir at the bottom of the hill that looks quite like the one in the picture. Most the colours are browns and greens of the plants and trees, the grey of the stones with some black where people have had fires whilst camping, in the back of a small cave which is part of the stone circle there is some moss that looks illuminous green. Emotionally the place feels peaceful, far away from the manufactured shapes, sights and sounds that make up most of my life. Although the forst has been shaped by man and the stones moved and carved, theres still organic feel about it. The texture of the place is rough, woody, waxy feel of the leaves, coursness of the stones and a spongy feel under the foot of the peat. The scents are usually of pine as the heat melts the sap a little. It\'s a beautiful place, kind of feels like home, like I belong there. Theres evidence of people who have been there but don\'t belong there such as litter and fires that have been started against the stones, horrible bastards.

The valley where this place is, does not have much traffic noise-so one car going by can be heard, maybe every 15 minutes. There is a view down the valley to the sea in the distant. In the valley are lots of trees and they hide houses, so the houses just peek out from them. The air is fresh but not fragrant. It is sea air.

It looks almost scary and incredibly beautiful and it excites me to think htat I am part of the same creat. It is truly amazing. We are standing here at the top with the Japanese tourists and their cameras and some hippie Argentinians rolling something on a bench on the side and signs that say do not climb and the wooden railing and I am thinking that if it breaks and we fall at least it will be a beautiful tragedy. I am so excited to be part of this world, even though it is so humid and the sun is burning my skin and probably I had to put on sunscreen, and so I probably smelled some sunscreen. There must be sweat pouring down and everything beyond is blue but we are on the wooden brown.

1691^NR^O^activity4^My place is on the balcony in the Marlborough Sounds with a view in both directions down the sound. The sounds I could hear are the lapping of the tide, and the wind in the trees, and on a sunny day, the loud chirp of cicadas. The colour of the sky is predominantly blue, although it can be gold, pink or red at sunset. The water and the land tend to be shades of green and blue depending on the light. The shapes of the land settling into the sea are like recumbent dinosaurs. Around me is the texture of warm wood of the balcony and I can feel the wind moving on my skin. It\'s warm and dry and I can smell the bush and just slightly, the tang of the sea.

1725^NR^O^activity4^I am in my backyard, and around me I hear birds, dogs barking and playing, the wind through the bare trees. I see the limbs of the trees large and small sway in this wind. The sky is bright blue scattered with grayish white clouds. the grass seems to be just a little greener than last week. Everything is wet, muddy the back deck is rough from the winter winds. it is cold outside and some wind chill, but not frigid. the melting snows have made the surfaces of everything wet. I can smell the earth, and when the wind blows a scent of the sea along with it

1682^CC^O^activity4^One of my most favorite places I\'ve been is a room in a relative\'s house. It was a patio room that had been added to the house, built around a big tree. There was a huge skylight that opened up and lots of large windows. A section of the room had lattice work on one of the walls - a wall facing the sun. I remember being fascinated with this room - an indoor room that had elements of the outdoors within it. There was a seat built of wood that surrounded the tree. Parts of the seat lifted up to reveal hidden treasures underneath. (Since I was little I couldn\'t lift the seat to look at the contents being stored there so I could only just imagine.)  There was a spot in particular that I loved in this room - it was a place where the sun came through the lattice work at just the right time of day. There was a tree outside that would block part of the sunshine, but not completely. If there was a breeze the leaves caused the sunlight to dance across the skin on my arm. I could feel the warmth of the sunlight moving. I could hear the birds singing outside in the tree, and hear the leaves gently rustle in the breeze. There was a blue wooden rocking chair with a paisley printed cushion that I would sometimes sit in. Some days I could hear the washing machine and on those days I\'d also watch my aunt hang the sheets out on the clothes line soon after the machine stopped. I suppose what I could see out the window doesn\'t count in this exercise though, does it.   It was a very peaceful room. Wooden floor. Flower pots with yellow and red flowers, don\'t know what kind but they smelled wonderful. A wooden bookshelf full of books, the bottom shelf being children\'s books. It was a great place.

1741^NR^O^activity4^My Backyard  Acres of a strange type of paradise.  Filled with the sounds of the dogs, and chicken.  The smell of fresh air and earth waiting to be tilled.  Crisp breeze blowing form the west, snow crunching under foot.  Unbelievable sunrises and sunsets filled with purples, pinks and oranges.  Surrounded by the Sangre de Cristo mountains with their almost magical and certianly mystical appeal.  My backyard is a little piece of paradise.

1778^CC^O^activity4^From inside the building, I would hear people walking by from outside.  Since it is a small place and I usually sit close to the entrance, I would occasionally hear the door open and close and feel gusts of wind whenever that happens.  Regarding structures inside the building, I would hear the vibration whenever somebody turns the structure on.  The colors are simple and the shapes are unchanging, with the exception of what I can see from outside, in the form of the occasional moving passerby.  Things feel slightly cold and dry and the scent smells like that of an old building.

1737^NR^O^activity4^An outdoor place that always springs to mind is the bank of the arrow river in Arrowtown.  I have spent time there in all seasons, and the last time I was there it imprinted itself firmly on to my memory because I was saying goodbye to the place and goodbye to a future I had been expecting.  I was incredibly sad while I was there and yet the beauty of my surroundings managed to seep into my consciousness.  The trees were budding, spring was coming to Arrowtown.  The river flowed steadily downhill below me.  The occasional person walked past I could hear their conversations but did not turn to them.  I watched the birds in the trees and the clouds as they floated slowly above.  Everything felt green and blue.  New buds, sky, water.  Wind in the trees, fluttering leaves, wind on my skin.    Tobin’s track ran up the hill in front of me, and I could vividly remember huffing and puffing my way to the top.  The day was warm, the sun shone on my bare arms, such a treat after a cold winter.  It felt as if everything was coming alive again.  It was beautiful in a way I can’t even touch with words.

1752^CC^O^activity4^In July 08 we stayed in Fiji for a week - the room I have picked is our room from the resort.   The room is about 6mx10 with a division for the Bathroom and wardrobes. It is mostly in Natural Brown colours and has a lot of wooden edgings and displays.     There are also Native paintings on the walls.     There is a large (VERY LARGE) raised bed in the centre of the room with lovely BIG puffy duvet & blankets. Lots of pillows. IT is a very comfy bed and as you lay down on it to begin with you sink intothe bedding. We stripped a layer of the bedding off as the weather was too hot for all the blankets, so the sinkign effect dulled slightly with less layers.     There is very little noise fomr the other units around us which is nice, we also had an end room which meant only neighbours above and on one side.   The noises you heard were mostly formt hte beach (which is about 30 meters away) and in the evening the frogs which were everywhere - if you walked on the lawn at night it looked like the lawn moved as the frogs got out of your way.     Inside the room was also an Airconditioning unit which was rather loud, but very needed! I found myself waking up at night thinking it was rainign - but it was actually the unit doings it thing...    There is also a table and chairs in the room and a sunbed near the large windows.     The windows and sliding door open directly out on to the beach and there is another set of chairs and a small table here so you can sit and enjoy the sun and surf. Also watching the sunset formt eh windows was facinating as the lights lite up on the pcean, of small ships (dinner cruises) who moved around the harbour. One day a LARGE cruise ship docked just off the coast - this was fasinating.     Lying around the room reading or relaxing watching TV was very pleasant - the room was quiet and spacious you could spend a large amount of time there with the Air COn on relaxing on the hotter days and feel quiet confortable, not at all clostrophobic.

1802^CC^O^activity4^I\'m sitting inside the spare room of our cottage. It\'s walls are yellow and the bare floorboards are polished. The room isn\'t tidy - it has become a store room to keep things that have been moved during baby/toddler proofing. Light floods through the two windows.    Outside, I can hear the trees gently swaying in the light breeze. I can hear our toddler marching up and down the deck, chuntering to himself. A bell bird sings, possibly from the flax bush just outside the room. The sounds are wonderful, an amazing range of tones filling the air.    From the other side of the house I can hear the whirling and thumping of the washing machine.    The sound of the occasionally car or tractor creeps in from the distance.    I can smell a sweet loaf baking in the kitchen. I can also smell sauerkraut fermenting. Not my favorite smell.    The floor is hard and cool but I sit comfortably on it. The room temperature is cool, the morning sun is on the other side of the house and this will soon heat up come lunchtime.    I notice a crystal light catcher hanging from the curtain rail. This sends light and rainbows dancing across the walls. I can see more out in the garden doing similar things. A triangle of light from the window reveals hundreds of dust motes traveling on unseen convection currents.

1811^NR^O^activity4^I\'m on vacation in the Maldives. It\'s 28C and the sun is very hot. I can hear cicadas singing, and the slow roll of waves breaking on the shore. The wet sand on the beach is cool beneath my feet, there is a light sea breeze and the smell of some tropical flower in the air. In the distance I hear a bird calling, and looking out to sea there are clouds on the horizon. Closer by, I hear the steady chug of the dive boats heading out to the reefs for the first dives of the day, and see they are all full of divers. I feel completely at ease and at peace with myself in this place.

1801^NR^O^activity4^Sounds of waves breakng, leaves rustling in the wind. Lots of cicadas chirping. The air is hot and dry but the water cool. The sky is blue and cloudless. Trees and rocks at the end of the beach provide welcome shade and hidden spaces. Water from a bottle is lukewarm with a plastic after-taste.   Smell of salt and seaweed. The sand is fine textured and but sticks to everything. Not too many insects to be a nuisance. There are a few families swimming and sitting on the beach. The water is a deep blue-green and looks clean. The lifeguard has a very bright yellow and red shade tent. There are a few holiday homes visible from the beach but the area is mostly plantation forest. One hill has recently been logged and is a mess of stumps and branches. People seem relaxed and happy.
