There were also bagels with the stew.  This quinoa was grown in South America in the Andes mountains.  It was organic.  The landscape in the Andes is quite different.  The altitude in many places is very high.   There are many native people still living in these areas.  The plant and animal life are different as well.  The lentils were dried.  They are from the United States.  They were not organic.  The carrots, onions and celery were not organic.  The carrots and onions were from Canada and the celery was from California.  The people in California would not be that different however, the plants and animal life would be different from Canada.    The Savory was from my own garden.  I grew it in the summer and froze it.  The vegetable stock is organic.  I don\'t know exactly where it was made.  The bagels were made at the Bagelshop down the street from my house.  I don\'t know where they get the ingredients to make the bagels.

Picked from trees the oranges are then gathered and brought to a factory to be processed. The climate is much warmer in Florida making it possible to grow oranges. In Florida the summer heat is more extreme and lasts for a longer period of time. The landscape is somewhat similar in that they have trees and lakes aswell however, they have palmtrees due to their warm climate. Many of the animals enjoy the hot weather such as a variety of snakes and lizard that would not far well living in Canada because of our cold winters!

The cows are raised for this purpose which makes me a little bit sad to think about. The potatoes most likely have come from PEI. They are grown in such a small community in the bright red soil. The broccoli may have come from Canada but it may also have come from somewhere in the South. Where it is warm and more humid than here. If it is from a Latin American country then it was probably grown using the hard labour of people who are severely underpaid and overworked. No childcare for the women and no health system in place.

The pasta obviously comes from wheat, which is made in farms, i really couldn\'t tell you which farm or where it is because I have no clue whatsoever. The shrimp and scallops come from the sea, I pretty sure from Halifax or P.E.I; we usually always get our fish from there. And the fish are caught in the boats, while looking at a spectacular scenery. the milk come from cows, I do not know which ones, or where they might come from, but I just hope they were fed well and not drugged up too much.

The Strokes are a New York-based rock band.  Their entire discography (I think) was recorded in New York.  Spending lots of time in Toronto this weekend, the place it was recorded is very similar to where I was because of the \"big city\" mentality.    Since they are a rock band that utilizes many lo-fi sound recordings, their recording isn\'t nearly as sophisticated as other bands (like Nickelback, if you consider them a band).  I assume it\'s a very low-key, comfortable location.

The meat products come from animals who are raised on farms and then slaughtered and shipped out to be sold and eaten.The place that the ingrediants of my pita come from is very different than where I am now. I am at school  in an urban environment. The ingrediants were grom in a rural area on a farm in nature.The weather is generally the same. The soil is moist and fertile in order to grow the vegetables and wheats. The landscape is more fields and open area whereas where I am now is industrialized with many buildings and roads. There are the same kinds of people who have different occupations (farming and animal raising) The plants are not as much for asthetic purposes and more for agricultural uses. The animals that live there are different because they have a purpose there. The animals where I am are mainly birds, squirrels, insects and rodents and are not resly interactive with people.

However, my mom bought it from the grovery store, where the farm sends it. Chickens are made similar to humans, yet live in eggs while they develop and then the egg hatches, signifying their birth. Due to the popularity of chicken, it is found all over the world. The weather and climate do not affect chickens particularly as they can survive here in Canada, as well as in more warm countries. What would differ however is the grain or food that the chickens are fed. Chickens can taste differently as well as the size can differ due to the food and grain they are given. The soil does not affect chickens as they do not grow out of the earth and soil. Every individual is different around the world, therefore there are different kinds of people in other locations who eat chicken as well as in Canada. These other countries however, have their own individual customs, therefore showing that they have their own plants and animals that are not found in Canada.

It was very hot, and tangy, and one of the things I like the most about this meal is the not-completely-cooked vegetables. I really like crunchy things, and this might be why stir fry appeals to me. Along with this I had water and about half a cup of vegetable crackers. It was a quick meal, which I thoroughly enjoyed.

In the recording studio, I think it would be much bigger than the university dorm that I;m in right now. It would be brightly lit becuase this song, although it is a powerful song, it has a happy tone to it.  The building would be more professional looking than the one I\'m in right now and instead of typical furniture that a student would have in their room, there would be recording equipment and microphones; office desks and professional looking people.

They work hard, and it is hot and dry there.  Its an exotic place completely different from Canada.

1124^CC^O^activity3^The music i listened to came from the radio and my i pod, i believe it was created in the states. The place that this was recorded was most likely in a recording studio in L.A, L.A is very different from where i am right know, the studio probably has a bunch of expensive equipment all around, and the lights there would be more intense than my normal kitchen lights. Those lights are bright and in your face at least thats how i picture they would be. The building is way different than mine , it is big and fancy where as mine is just an average looking bungalow house There is none of the same decor in my home except for maybe some plants and pictures.

Some of them form China, and others are created by artists in worldwide (eg: U.S, PARIS, CANADA etc).   I was living in China, it\'s quite different as Canada, they use different couture, language, custom to record the music.  I think they produce by somewhat same music studio, like EMI etc.  All most same, I mean the buliding, lighting, equipment and decor.

1186^CC^O^activity3^The music I\'m thinking of is \'One\' by Metallica. It\'s from the United States. It was produced and released in Los Angeles, CA. Right now, I\'d say LA is probably a polar opposite to Ottawa. For one, Ottawa is cold as hell, and LA is probably pretty nice. I\'d imagine the studio to have a cold atmosphere. It\'s probably jammed ull of techy machines and the like, which never gives a very personable feeling. The lighting would probably have to be pretty high, otherwise the musicians couldn\'t see their instruments and the technicians couldn\'t see the sliders. The building would be relatively large and soundproofed, obviously. The one I\'m in now is dirty but well lit, and not nearly as soundproofed as I\'d like it. The only \'equipment\' around here is a cash register, and, clearly, producing studios have better technology.

I bought this from the Uni-Centre and I would imagine that the bread, meat, and the vegitables are made/produced in Canada and sent here somehow. And since I\'m in Canada now, I would like to think that what I ate now is pretty much similar if not same as what you would normally eat here.  The weather was freezing. And it made it all more gloomy by being all cloudy today. Due to the cold weather, I think that the soil became hard because it wasn\'t all that pushy(?) like it was a few days ago. And maybe it\'s the weather, but the people are wearing thicker clothing to protect themselves from the weather and the animals are somewhat disappearing from human eyes even more as time goes by. As they should...

My pita was a chicken ceaser pita. So the vegtables in my pita wear grow either on a farm or in a frow house. The pita bread is made from wheat which is grown on a farm and the chicken that was most likely raised on a farm. Im not really 100% sure exactlly sure where this food all came from but i am going to guess it came from the states because of the time of year it is and our harvest season is over.

Where i am now,is very nice,with environment very well taken care of,and the education is of great quality!

The song talks about her going to an ex-lovers house, reliving memories and eventually finding a love letter from his new interest.  She seems to be singing from a dark, deep, emotional place - I picture her singing it in a small, casual, intimate venue.  I picture it being low lit, and quiet.  I picture her sitting on a stool on a large area rug - a bohemian theme.  I picture the band only being a guitar in the shadows behind her.  This is similar to the place I am right now - I am in a basement with a book and music in the background.

The type of soil, the human geography, and the growing situation of both location are quite similar. Seeing as Leamington is not an exotic or international place, and also in the same province as Ottawa there are not very many noticeable distinctions between the two locales. The weather in Leamington in the Spring Summer and Fall are all pretty much the same, however in the winter time Ottawa gets a lot more snow than Leamington does.

I can see this being developed in a basement, sound room or some form of studio that the band had set up. The company that produced this bands song would be a very open minded style, they would have to be looking for something not normal to the culture but can still be a hit. the lighting would be much like that of a basement, it doesnt need to be bright, theres no videos so it would be set up to be comfortable so the artist was relaxed.The setup would be very different than my dorm room. Plently of electronics and noise reducing equipment.

With warmer all year weather, and animals that cannot survie in the cold weathers of Canada.  The item is grown on trees and picked by workers, they transported to Canada.  The area they come from is much different than Canada.  The soil there is warmer and less dense than the soil here. The soil here is much thicker and wet.  The landscape  is much flatter than that of Canada\'s.  The typical people who live in these tropical places are darker skinned, and do not live in as much wealth as us. They use labour to earn moeny and work longer harder days. The majority of work is argiculutrual.  The plants there are oragne trees, palm trees and other tall trees, however there is little small vegitation there. In canada we have a large mix of trees and plants, howerver they must be able to survie our cold winters.

It was still warm so i just ladelled a big bowlful of carrots and potatoes and onions and garlic and leeks from our garden into the bowl and went upstairs to see her. Alll the stuff in the stew except for the barley and celery came from the farm here. The celery\'s probably from california or mexico and probably had a factory life and was grown by factory workers and the barley and soup mix probably came from all over the place...barley probably canada cuz we still grow barley here and i think we still have a single desk system for barley although that may be the one that harper and his idealogues already gutted. the beans and stuff may be from america or mexico or from canada, but they\'re all things that grow best in a climate close to ours, although some of them like a little more soil than we have in lanark county. The lamb was from the farm here and was just a bag of soup bones that i threw into the pot on the cookstove while i did my homework and housework on sunday. We\'ve had a terrible year for wolves taking sheep this year...lost about 33 sheep...so the lamb tastes pretty damn sweet. Cindy complains a bit that it was hard to get all the little bones out of the stock pot today cuz i threww the soup mix in and it was all mixed up together in the bottom of the pot when she went into the cold room to scrape off the fat and add the veg today. i guess i shouldn\'t have added the soup mix to the stock pot!I thank her for finishing the stew and eat up my bowlful before bed.

Those music were recorded overseas in Taiwan. Taiwan is a total different place than Canada. It\'s oriantal and the city I lived in is the capital of Taiwan so it\'s extremely busy, Eventhough Taipei is also the capital city, it\'s nothing like Ottawa, and it\'s much more busy in all ways. So many citizens and so many traffics. The music record company I imagin should be decorated confortablely in a way, and it must be owned by a group of people who love and enjoy the music.

She explains how this tribe is becoming more modernized and has the risk of loosing their tradition in the next generations to come. They are becoming more modernized by buying clothes, televisions, gas, medicine and so on. The medicine-mas on their community no longer uses the natural plants but relies on medicine from the \"white people\". however they are being introduced to new sicknesses like pneumonia and malaria which they do not have the medicine for. It is interesting to see the effect on this sort of culture and communtiy.

In my case it was a \'Canadian\' pizza meaning t had pizza sauce, cheese, mushrooms, green pepper, pepperoni and bacon. If the pizza were from Italy I\'d imagine it would be quite different. I\'d imagine Italy is somewhat similar to living here. Many of the same types of people, plants and animals. I\'d say it\'s probably warmer in Italy than here.

1217^NR^O^activity3^Tonight for dinner I had rice and chicken. The food I ate would probably come from a farm somewhere, I am not sure of the exact location. Usually chickens are born and raised on a farm, and usually grains of rice are also grown in a farm. There are farms in Canada, and probably in a lot of other countries too. Agriculture is a main source for most food. The weather would have to be warm enough to grow the rice grains and to raise the chicken. I don\'t really know much about how food is produced so it is hard for me to answer some of these questions. People who work on a farm usually live a pretty simple kind of life and are very hard working. They usually live out in the country where they own a big enough proportion of land to farm on. Farmers usually are very well mannered, have very close families, and also keep religion a part of their lives.

After the cows have been milked and the milk has been collected, it goes through a number of heating/cooling processes to pasteurize it and make it safe for drinking. If it is made in Canada, the weather is what I\'m used to. drastically cold in the winter and humid and hot in the summer. I\'m not 100% sure about what the soil is like though. The landscape is probably similar to where I live, lots of greenery and fields and I believe that the people and plants and animals are fairly consistent throughout the country.

1263^NR^O^activity3^The most recent beverage I drank was a starbucks pumpkin spice frappuccino and a banana loaf slice (also from starbucks). The pumpkin spice frappuccino is a seasonal drink, and has the following ingredients: pumpkin spice flavor shot, milk, espresso, and whipped creme. The creme products are probably Canadian, since most dairy products are not imported. The bananaloaf is probably made in Canada (possibly local, since they have different selection of treats depending on the exact location). For example, in Winnepeg the treat selection is different and has a snack with saskatoon berries (local). The espresso beans are probably from Ethiopia or a similar location. The climate would be must hotter, and more exotic, with moist soil. The landscape would be very different, compared to Ottawa during the colder season. When I think of Ethiopia, fast runners come to mind. In terms of plants: the coffee and espresso bean are definitely plants that we do not have here, hence why starbucks and other coffee companies continue to exploit workers in poorer countries (with hot climates to grow produce). The cultures would be African/ Eastern ones. I would picture lush vegetation, brighter colours, maybe palm trees, or African jungles, with some deserts, and rugged turf. I think that the terrain / climate would vary depending on the area. Coffee beans / espresso beans require a lot of man labor to produce (intensive process) and requires quite a bit of area to grow.

Belleville is similar to Ottawa being only 3 hours away. It gets fairly cold in the winter and very warm in the summer. The soil is good I guess, there\'s a lot of farm land around and if they grow apples every year I guess it has to be good. The landscape is similar with less high rises and more residential. It is much smaller than Ottawa. There are mainly only Caucasians in Belleville, they do not have as much of a diverse population as Ottawa. The same plants and animals inhabit it though.

I\'ve always associated that with the flavour of potatoes! Dark, rich, moist soil. Not hot, but warm to cool fresh air. Invigorating climate. Primary colour haven... Everything seems more pure here.  Bread... Think of western Canada, stretching fields, warm sun, light breeze. Beautiful colours: golden grains, brown earth, blue sky. Quiet. Can hear the wind, maybe birds, the contents of the fields swishing and swaying. Very peaceful, calm.   Iced Tea... I think of Florida! (Only my version includes sugar!) It\'s HOT! Intense sun, hard, thin earth. Dried tea mimicking the effects of the heat/dehydration. Cool water, ice cubes and a clear tall glass, sweating with condensation. Lots of lush greenery... palm trees, flowers, beautiful scents and sounds. Lots of activity. Feels alive.

It\'s generally warmer there and I almost see that reflected in the warmth and happiness of the music. The recording has a sort of \'indie\' sound to it that\'s not meant to be crystal-clear like many pop songs on the radio. I feel like the lighting would be a deep yellow and the studio might have a rustic wooden feel to it. It would be very different than a residence house, like the one I\'m in now. I picture big soundboards, acoustic guitars, large high-quality microphones and a bunch of synthesizers. I\'ve never been to Georgia or a recording studio, but this is my guess based on movies and word-of-mouth.

1194^CC^O^activity3^I think the recording came from the U.S. somewhere.  It\'s a peice by matchbox 20.  The song is a moderate tempo, and it makes me feel happy (I can\'t really explain why).  THe words aren\'t even all that \"upbeat\" or happy.  Rob Thomas had once said that he composed it about a time when he was around the age of 13 when his mother was suffering from cancer.  But I think it make me feel happy because the tempo is moderately quck throughout the song and the intruments that are used compliament each other very well.  There are very few minor keys in the song (composed of mostly majors).  I can play the song and I have been reviewing it based on a mental schema I have in mind of when I play it myself.  I mostly review it for small subtle things that I can add in.  However overall, I think that it has an impact on me because it has slow and fast points in it where its easy to think about various things when its playing (ie. its an easy listen).  Going back to some of the questions above, seeing that the United States seems to have a somewhat similar, fast paced, industrialized society, I think that most of the building, studio, and decor would be similar to things that are seen in Canada.

I would imagine that since it\'s a smaller band, the place that they recorded it would be a bit smaller too, less flashy equipment. But at the same time, it\'s not recorded in a basement.  So it\'s just a smaller record label. I would imagine it is different from where i am because i am in a house, so that is one major difference. The equipment there would be mostly recording equipment, and instruments.

This simple method requires sound planning and servicing of the water damming and channeling.While with rice growing and cultivation the flooding is not mandatory, all other methods of irrigation require higher effort in weed and pest control during growth periods and a different approach for fertilizing the soil. rice is originated from china. the taste is not different at all. but here we get clean and refined rice where as back home rice sack used to contain some stones and some bugs in the rice. the weather of my backhome is tropical. its always warm and hot. backhome theres only two month of winter but compared to canada it would be spring  for canada. soil is dry . no the landscape is not same. it is a very small country smaller than a ontario province. most of the asians people live there, its not immigrated country. about the plants only difference is flowers hav nicer smell or strong smell compared to canada\'s flower.

The recording comes from the United States, which is a similar place to Canada. The music studio would probably be peaceful because it is a slow, soft song..there probably aren\'t many people around. The lighting would be soft, not too light, but not too dark...and I imagine that the building would be way bigger than my house, and there would be a lot of technology (microphones, computers) in the music studio.

The recording of this song was probably done in the US because it is not a Canadian band.  US is not really that different than Canada so the origin of the music is not that important.  If I imagine the recording studio, its like something that you would see on TV.  The lighting would be very bright and it was would be really dull and boring.  The building would probably not be the same as the one I am living in in residence.  The studio is probably a little space in the middle of a downtown.

Pictures of the recording artists from this studio receiving awards etc.  pictures of recording artists at cd release parties.  i would imagine there to be a lot of flashy frames and flashy cds and awards, etc.  much different from my paler, less bright/flashy surroundings.

The song originated in the USA, and I imagine that it was recorded in a dark, relaxed room. The song has a very soothing, yet sad tone to it. It is about a family that was torn apart by abuse. It is beautifully tragic.  The space where the song was recorded, I imagine was somewhat different then where I am right now.  I imagine that the recording company would be more into soulful and Indie styled musicians.

1236^CC^O^activity3^The recording I chose comes from a young Canadian pop artist. He was born and raised in Ontario, Canada, and his music often reflects his Canadian heritage. The recording was likely made in a recording studio, as his music label is Canadian and his producers are Canadian as well. I\'m not sure exactly where in Canada the recording studio is, but I would assume that it is fairly close to his home city of Toronto. The recording studio is one in which many hip-hop and pop artists have recorded their music. I am currently in my basement at home. The recording studio is likely very \"roomy\", very comfortable in order to allow the record artist to relax and record his music with ease. My basement is unfinished, which is very contrary to what the recording studio would most likely look like. My basement has cement floors, pipes on the ceiling, and simple white paint on the walls. It is not very comfortable, it is more cold than anything. The music studio is most likely finished and decorated very nicely. The record company is most likely very professional and understanding of the need to decorate their recording studios to accommodate their artists. The lighting is surely bright inside the recording room, enough for the producers to see everything they need. Inside the actual studio where the artists record, it is most likely dimmer to provide a more relaxing feel to the room. The studio is only one room inside an entire building with different rooms, and my house is not as complex. The decor in the studio is likely very detailed, and as I said, made to accommodate the artist, whereas my basement is cold and unfinished.

1242^CC^O^activity3^Today i listened quite a bit to \'around the world\' by ATC. It\'s a really great song actually; it gets me pretty pumped up and really energetic. I love it so much! I actually have no idea where this recording came from. It\'s a few years old and I actually remember hearing when i was younger that this girl (ATC) was from Sweden or some country around there. I\'m not really sure if I believe that because firstly, the song is infact in english, and secondly, it doesn\'t sound like she has any kind of accent whatsoever. But come to think of it, alot of singers from countries other than the US and Canada don\'t seem to have accents while their singing. When I think of this song, I think of the whole techno genre. I feel like a song like this would be recorded in some sort of studio in which theres massive soundboards and alot of software to make these crazy sounds that are in these songs. I picture ATC in the studio singing  under dim lighting, maybe even with some sort of glow in the dark object on the walls or something. Whenever i hear this song, actually, I think of laser quest, a laser tag building in London, Ontario. Laser quest is pretty much dark, at least the playing area is; but theres glow in the dark paint all over the place and really light coloured clothing shines in this place. I don\'t know why I think of Laser Quest when i hear \'Around the World\', but i do! I might have heard it while I was there one day when i was younger...who knows! Whenever I picture a recording studio, I picture a brown-brick building, like a townhouse which is downtown. It\'d be completely different from my house; a little bit different from my res, but completely different from my actual house. I picture this building as very plain, for the most part. It\'d have long arched windows all up it. It actually reminds me of the townhouse that the Tanners live in on Full House! Once i get inside the studio, I would go right downstairs into the basement, because that\'s where the studio is going to be. It would probably be very professional looking, with the whole soundboard room separated from the room the singer is in singing. I\'m realizing that this studio I\'m picturing is the same as many in movies I\'ve seen. Like Dreamgirls, for instance, when Beyonce is singing \'Listen\' in the recording studio. The equipment in the studio would most definitely be different than my building I\'m in right now. In my room, and even the whole building, there\'s definitely no kinds of materials good for a recording studio. Actually, the decor is pretty much the same! In recording studios, I picture brown brick and beige walls within. And in my building, all the bricks are beige and come to think of it, the walls with the glass windows that seperate a floor from the stairwell is almost exactly what I\'m picturing when I picture the separation in an actual recording studio. Actually, my friend back in London, who is a musical genius, has a recording studio of his own in his basement and it looks alot like the studio im picturing. So, back to \'Around the World\'! I\'m not quite sure where ATC is from, but it sounds like she\'s from somewhere english, and I feel like the recording studio in which she recorded this wonderful song is alot like the one im picturing inside my head. Techno always gives me a great feeling; it always gives me energy and \'Around the World\' is probably one of my favourite techno songs ever!

Their record company supports many Canadian bands and all of this artistic mellow vibe which I enjoy. I see the record company or studio with a lot of coffee, many abstract paintings and in an old loft filled with wood and empty space. There are some beat up couches and chairs, but of much comfort. The lighting is of spot lights, brighter in some areas than others. You can curl up and look out a huge bright window over a busy city to see what you will write about next.

Depending on where in Canada it comes from I couldn\'t be sure what the weather and climate is, probably chilly. As for the soil I would say that it was hard from the cold (though I\'m sure that\'s not what you mean by the question, but I don\'t know what to say otherwise). We\'ll say that the landscape is probably the same, as in flat and uninteresting. I\'m someone ho believed that no matter where in the world people are people and though may have countless discrepancies from each other, right down to it we\'re all human with the same instincts.

1277^NR^O^activity3^Most recently, I drank a bottle of Nestea, natural lemon flavour. I have no idea where it comes from, but I will consult the bottle. It is a product of the Coca Cola Company, and was produced in Toronto, Canada. There is sugar in the juice, and I\'m assuming that sugar comes from somewhere not close to CANADA.It probably comes from somewhere hot, with a humaid temperature. For some reason, I think of a rain forest, even though that\'s where it grows. Another place that comes to mind is Africa and Jamaica. I picture the soil very rich and never frozen. I picture the temperature to be always warm, hot and humid. This of course is very different from where we are now where we have seasons where the temperature reaches exact opposites,

I guess the coffee beans are probably imported to a factory in the US where they are cooked and ground and put into the ugly pink \"support breast cancer\" tin.  The milk comes from cows, to the processor, and is sold.  There was a dairy farm really close to my house, where I am going this weekend.  Maybe the coffee beans are from Columbia.  I have a friend from Columbia who said the coffee there is much better than here.  When I think of Columbia, I think of coffee and cocaine.  I imagine it\'s warm there, with big leafy trees and what not.  The people are probably not that different from people here, polite, yet always watching out for their own best interests.

The area it orginates from is a little more natural then the place I am now. Though it is possible to have an apple tree in your yard if you wish. The weather is the same as it is here. Snowy and cold in the winter, warm and humid in the summer and everything inbetween. The soil is rich and healthy so the trees can grow properly. The landscape is apporoimately the same. Apple trees don\'t require living on flat terrain. The same people, plants and animals would interact with the apple tree as would with me.

I always check to see where my food came from... It is impossible to buy shrimp from anywhere but foreign countries. ANd i\'ve become aware of buying food close to home. On the bag it said the shrimp were farmed. I started to think that this whole shrimps purpose was to be eaten. And I wondered if it was in a crowded tank. Then that started me thinking about the show i had watched on animals in factory farms and how they are sooo mistreated so that we can consume them and they can make more money. I\'m a huge animal lover but never really thought about the animals I was actually eating.

It was surprising that he was on this track as a featured artist because this song was not in his realm of his music that he is known for. And the main artist I had never heard of, so to me it seems that the song is only big because of this featured artist. Also, I think that his part makes the song the best but I guess I could feel that way because I am a big fan of his music. The song was most likely produced in USA, probably in a fancy studio with a lot of high profile people around.

Although I\'ve never been to China I\'ll assume that it is very different from Canada in many different ways. The weather and Climate is probably very temperate near the ocean and possible cold in the southwest near the mountains. It is far more populated and has a lower standard of living than Canada and because of that my food was probably made by a 6 year old child in a factory.

I do not feel that the USA, is very different from Canada in many of our cultural or musical values.  A main difference between the USA and Canada involves the crashing of the stock market, which affecting the USA much more then Canadian markets.  The recording was definitley made in some type of recording studio...perhaps in LA, where many recordings take place.  The music studio I would imagine to be very large and have many expensive electronics inside of it which aid in the recording process.  i dont think that the building would be the same as mine, because I live in a townhouse, and I would imagine the recording would occur in a large office building with a large lobby and had elevators to get to the desired office.  I would imagine the decor to be very similar to my living room because it has very many band posters.  although in a recording studio i would imagine that it would be much more expensive type of music decor.

I assume this item comes from a factory because really, so cheese is that soft and orange and bubbly without some serious chemicals. This product was probably made either in Canada or the States so approx. the same climat as here, possibly warmer because its damn cold here. I think there are the same kind of people, although Canada is a multi cultured country. The people that work in factries range from CEO\'s to workers, so there would be a wide range of schooling from high school diplomas to masters and possibly PHD\'s. The ground in factories are probably gray concrete and nothing special, the walls are probably dull, it differs alot from where I am now because at the moment im in my room where there is carpet and clothes on my floor and there are colourfull walls. I\'m sincerely hoping that there are no animals aka bugs in the factory where my snackpack was made, maybe there were some plastic plants somewhere.

The studio I\'m picturing is based on those I\'ve seen on TV shows... lots of lights flashing, the artist standing in a box being told to sing certain parts over and over again, lots of people watching and giving feedback, sitting on desk chairs. This doesn\'t relate to me at all really on a physical level. If I got metaphorical, then I definitely see similarities (people standing around, judging me as per their expectations, me trying over and over again to make them happy) but as an environment, this is actually opposite to the type of place I try to be in - I prefer something much more comforting, soothing soft lights, earth tones and candles!

I know that some food comes from Ontario, that some food comes from other parts of Canada, and that some food comes from another country. Some fruit that we get in Canada is always from somewhere else, a place that the fruit can grow in the proper conditions. Those conditions could be warm with a lot of rainfall, or no rainfall, etc. Because  the world is so different, we are able to enjoy a variety of food. The choices we have are incredible. Some people\'s lives revolve around making good food for people. With that passion, great things come to life. With different people come different ideas, different landscape, weather, and climate mean different fruits and vegetables and other foods that people can enjoy. There is just so much that people can enjoy, and I guess it\'s sort of strange to realize just how much choice we really have.

I am nt sure where it was recorded and what country it originated from but it did reach 13 or so countries. All of them European or Asian. Elsewhere, the song peaked at #2 in the United Kingdom and Germany, #11 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, and #12 in Australia. I think the music building where it was recorded must have been bright, cheery and very upbeat because thats how the song is. It must have been a nice free of worry building where nothing matters but the music being made. The dances and moves in the movie also show no worry or stress and are very upbeat and happy. The song really makes me feel strong and energized and I thikn thats why I listen to it so much.

1357^NR^O^activity3^Since I moved to Ottawa for school, the difference in selection of food from my home of Vancouver has been obvious.  The sheer availability of shawarma and other middle eastern food has been astounding.  I was aware of it in BC, and enjoyed it on occasion, but I have it here much more frequently.  I know very little about the origin of this food, and less about the true nature of middle east.  Thus, I believe any underlying desire to eat it is not a connection to the history of the food itself, but rather my own life in Vancouver.  The weather in Ottawa is certainly much more unpredictable and much less tame than Vancouver\'s, and I don\'t find myself yearning for a middle eastern climate.  For me, the connotations brought by eating shawarma have conjured memories of my last year of high school when I first really discovered it (along with the freedom and joy that went along with being in grade 12).  I would go out of my way to find it back then, and now I am surrounded by it.  My only hope is that I don\'t over-saturate my diet with it, and lose the connection to these happy memories.

It is made with rice paper, shrimp, noodles and lettuce and comes with a delicious peanut sauce. Asia, to the best of my knowledge, is quite different from here. Unfortunately I don\'t know very much about this place. I know that it is a place with a higher population and that they have some plants and animals that are different. For example pandas are not found in Canada and babmboo is naturally grown there. Also people are much more collectivistic where as Canadadians are more individualistic.

The landscape is lush, filled with greenery and dark soil. This landscape compares slightly with my current landscape - plenty of trees and a lot of grassy land. It differs in the respect that there are more buildings in my current landscape, more human involvement. The climate where this lettuce has been grown in not much different than the current climate, it is pleasantly warm in the summers and cold in the winters, with enough rainy days in the summer to be able to grow plentiful crops.

We got the dough from Loblaws along with Kraft Italian shredded cheese, green peppers, mushrooms, and chicken sausages.     I\'m sure the vegetables used comes from Canada and is grown more than likely at an outdoor farm. I am in the middle of a city so making the areas very different. In ottawa it rained all day but I\'m sure in the farming regions, it was the same. The landscape is probably the same except for the fact that Ottawa has large buildings, busy streets, and a lot of people where the farm land is not as busy as it is here.     The cheese used probably came from a food processing factory somewhere in the states. The demographics are probably the same, with the factory being somewhere in the city. The milk for the cheese however comes from the cows in farming regions like the vegetables explained above.     The chicken pieces used probably came from the same places as the cheese and vegetables. The chickens are raised on a farm and the meat is processed in a slaughter house/factory

It would be completely different from my house, i grew up in a house with 6 kids so we couldn\'t afford anything sleek or modern... or any type of upto date music equipment and technology.

Bananas need a warmer climate to grow in then here. THey would have to be grown in a more tropical area, or one where there is less chance of freesing/long periods of snow. Mybanana grew on a tree in a bunch. Some bananas are grown in the sourthern states, this area is not that much different then ours except for a few culutural differences. Bananas can also come from places that are extremly diffrent then here. THe weather is ussualy much warmer year round, the landscape would be different.

My boyfriend recognized it but not as janis joplin\'s song. He thought that cypress hill used the beat in their song \'hits from the bong\'. He stopped Janis\' song to play the Cypress Hill one to compare. But it sounded nothing alike, so he figured he had mistaken \'hits from the bong\' from a difference Cypress Hill song. So we changed it back to Janis Joplin. Upon hearing it again he was sure that he had the right  Cypress Hill song and put it back on. Fastforwarded into the middle of the track. Still they sounded nothing alike. He gave up and put \'son of a preacher man\' back on and by that time I was ready to leave. So I never got to listen to the whole song. I love her voice. Somehow it seemed to fit perfectly for that era in music. I feel like I am being transported to the 60\'s. Things would be slower passed. There would be a lot more passion for things we cared about. People would be more personal with one another.

The city is different from this one, as it is bigger and bussier... Ottawa on the other hand is nice and calm and even though it is also a big city, it has a warmer feeling to it as though it was a much smaller town.  I don\'t know about studios or recording companies/ devices... But I imagine it is a large, neat-looking building. In the inside it would b spacious, maybe red toned decorations.

But not far from where i am can it be very country. or maybe be simliar to the same place they are talking about in the song.  I would think the recording studio would be quite modern. Filled with pictures and Autographs of other preformers who have recorded there. I think the music studio would be a very calm yet excited group of supportive people where family values are highly honoured.  The lighting would be that nice humble lighing where no one looks very bad in it. Unlike the lighting they sometimes have in bathrooms that are really bright that make everyone look terrible. The building is not like mine. There would be different types of equipment in accordance with the type of instruments that are needed to be played in a certain song.

My song is the only thing I have really listened to in the past few days and because it is still a work in progress I have listened to it a couple of hundred times. So to answer the questions: the song was recorded in Canada. It was created by a Canadian. The place it was recorded in is exactly where I am sitting right now (in my bachelor apartment). To the describe my apartment/recording studio, I have one rather spacey room with a kitchen and walk-in closets joining the washroom. I have painted it is bright, vibrant blues and white. There is original artwork in 7 areas, each approximately 4\'x7\' and are very abstract and colorful. Half of my apartment is a floor-to-ceiling, wall-to-wall window so I have an incredible view of downtown from my tenth floor apt, and I never feel as though I am trapped in a box because I don\'t have curtains. There is minimal lighting because I use the daylight, but at night I have three warm, dimmed lights. My apartment the biggest source of my happiness because it is so perfect for me. I have moved every year of my life and have never considered any of my houses homes, but this feels like home...

Ok, this is rediculous. i don\'t know how people in Europe make their buildings and how they light them. The decor is not something i think about to be honest.

The studio which they recorded the album should be a quite dark place and has many different colors of lights.

I really have no idea what a typical recording studio looks like, and i dont have the same equipment in my house (?). I\'m assuming it was quite different from a typical western recording studio nowadays, because it is older music. The technology is much more advanced. Im assuming it was probably in a jazz studio, and i dont have alot of jazz-related objects in my house...   It was probably in a very clean typical building, probably very much unlike my house, because my house is warm and very decorated.

The weather is relatively warm and humid in the summer and cold in the winter. The soil in the areas where the apples are from have fertile land.

1395^NR^O^activity3^Rice. On the package it was stated that the product was from Thailand. I can relate to these geographical area quite personally, since it\'s situated in southeast asia. It is staple food of many cultures and considered International Year of Rice in 2004 by the United Nations. There are many kinds of rice, but the kind I had was white rice. With a rice cooker, I takes only about 15-20 minutes to have fresh warm rice that you can enjoy. The warmth of it in your stomach is quite the sensation, and makes you appreciate it when millions of others in third world countries are starving and don\'t even have a single grain to eat. Knowing this the thought of how all the grain that goes into Meat Industry in the USA alone, can feed the world if there was about 8 billion people in the world. Now that\'s more than enough for everyone. I know that recently rice prices are going up, well at the time i was watching the news back in the summer, currently my knowledge of that information is unknown. The process of making rice is requires a lot on how the terrian and climate is, for example in countries like Vietnam or Thailand, etc. they have wetlands that necessary to plant the rice. Even the process of planting and growing and harvesting rice is enduring; and like many other farmers, it\'s a year long thing. I know the country this package of rice that I ate is from Thailand, and that country is quite hot. It\'s your typical jungle terrian, and if you want to have a glimpse watch some Vietnam War based movies, even though the ironic thing is that most of these films are not even filmed on location. But the sense and atmosphere is there. Compare that to here in Canada, it\'s quite the extreme opposite. We have 4 distinct season, but that\'s only when the weather isn\'t messed up from global warming... but usually it\'s quite colder here. But, it is possibly to have rice here, such as wild rice. I\'m not really sure the process of how this is harvest or such, but the image of swamp lands come into mind. The only time I tried this kind of rice was back in residence, where they had some for serve. The texture is quite different from white rice; where it\'s moderate soft, when wild rice is quite harder in texture. I haven\'t visted the countries where my rice is from, but i presume the soil is much softer and in some parts very wet. Comparing that to here, we have many kinds of areas, but particularly i\'m use to harder soil. The landscape in countries such as Vietnam, i know for sure, has more flatlands. In Canada, we have all sorts of lands, that is why during WWII, Canada was the idea location for training; we have desert like conditions in the west, the artic areas in the north, jungle in BC, mountains, urban, etc. Are the people the same? No, Canada is all about diversity, cause most people from the rest of world tend to try and come to North America, not commonly the other way around. So that\'s probably why you see less of diversity in the countries were my rice is from. Animals... i do not know too much on exact species but i do not that Canada has animals that relate to it\'s vast landscape of different terrians, and in Southeast asia, it\'s more of the jungle critters that roam the land.

1301^NR^O^activity3^I ate a bacon & chicken sub today which consists of a variety of vegetables and chicken and bacon. All of which are grown on a farm. the vegetables in a field, of course, and the chicken and pig which reside in a barn somewhere out in the country. Farmhands are needed regularly each day to feed the chicken and pig so that they may grow big and be in health for when the time comes to send them to a meat house to slaughter them for meat. The vegetables need sometimes to be sprayed with pesticides to keep the insects away. The soil and weather need to be consistent with the vegetables needs for healthy growth. Farmers need to be available to harvest the products. Out on the farm, we are in a different environment. Farmland resides in the country with more open fields, trees, animals. In the city we are congested with apt buildings and townhouses and people and vehicles and everyone is polutting the air. In the country the air feels cleaner, smells more of nature than of garbage or car exhaust. People are friendlier too, everyone smiles, waves, and says hello to whoever they pass whether they know them or not. In the city, people avoid making eye contact.

The culture and people much different from my own.  Much more inequality in wealth and opportunity.  The farm where this fruit is grown probably is owned by someone wealthy, likely white.  Black labourers probably picked the fruit, and live in very basic living quarters, a concrete box, with few opportunities to improve the quality of their lives.  Ironic that South Africa is a wealthy country, yet wealth is so unevenly divided.

I can imagine the activities going on. Rock climbing, I\'ve done it before but if I had a chance to choose a trip I would choose to go rock climbing in Switzerland.

He is from Turkey.  I think the life he has lead, and the lives of the many people that make up the band reflects in the music.  It has an ecclectic sound, that is very different then anything that is frequently played on the radio.  I imagine the company that produced the record had a building very similar to those that are found downtown.  I  would also assume that the inside of the building would be like any office building.  But if I think about the atmosphere in the recording studio, it would be very different.  I envision a dim lit room, with carpeting, and some sort of aromatherapy scents.  The music is very worldly, and I like to think that the mood was rather light.  I like to think that the singer would be moving around or dancing joyfully.

The drink was most likely created somewhere in Canada due to the difficulties shipping liquids over borders. It is made by having filtered water and carbonating it and mixing it with a bunch of chemicals to give it taste, colour, and drugs that will help to keep me awake and alert (at least I hope it does, otherwise it is a waste of $3) I am not entirely sure where in Canada it was made but I assume it would probably be somewhere with a lot of manufacturing infrastructure so i guess it would be made in southern ontario or quebec which is pretty much exactly like here but one is less french and the other is more.

That is what DJ\'s do. The mixes that you used were many and varied and I don\'t know all of them, I remember hearing some EFM7 and a track titled \'Shiny Silver Disco Balls\'. But I really couldn\'t tell you where they come from. UK? US? So the set that I listened to was created right there in front of me, so by someone in my country. Not a recording, Devon can\'t record he doesn\'t have the equipment, he has a routine and DJ\'s everything live, right there and then. I\'m thinking about the place that it originates from and that is Devon\'s living room.  The difference of that place to where I am now is that that place is is Carleton Place I am in Ottawa, I am in a bedroom that place was a liviing room. I am alone in my bedroom. I was with many dancing people in his living room.  The lighting was mostly black light, some light coming in from other rooms in the house, I don\'t recall any other fancy forms of lighting. The building was a small really well decorated house compared to my slightly larger not as well decorated house. Devon\'s mom is an interior designer, their house is gorgeous! Different equipment than my house obviously because he has DJ equipment, black light, records and I don\'t. His mom is a interior designer so their decor is fabulous and mine is average. Nodarok is a pretty badass DJ. For someone so young he spins pretty well. That is all I got. Peace out folks. I hope that is good enough. :)

The milk comes from cow, which is also in a farm; however, in some countries, people keep animals like cows and buffalo\'s in there own houses. Where they produce milk and some people sell it and make money and some do not. However, the milk comes from a cow, and I personally drank 2 percent milk. The climate depends on where the eggs and milk came from; however, I would assume that it is most likely warm and not so chilly or snowy. The people, plants and animals are probably the same. I would think that they are the same, because Canada is so multicultural, that it really allows one to assume that the culture and people are most likely quite similar.

Since all the items I ate did not involve produce, I would think that they all came from somewhere relatively close with around the same place. The only exception I can think of would be potatoes, and I have no idea where potatoes are actually grown. Maybe somewhere warmer, with richer soil than we have ear, perhaps out east? The people would be the same I assume if the potatoes are grown in Canada, however I find that even between provinces the culture of the people is different, because of the weather, the landscape and the way of life.

I don\'t really know much about music, either I like it or I dont and thats all I usually care about, but I\'m guessing that their music is created in the United States. Seeing as its country music, I think of southern accents, deserts, bars and saloons,cowboys, and easy going people. Very different form the uptight people, cold weather, and multiple dance clubs of Ottawa.  Based on the music and genre, I imagine the studio to be friendly, and the people to be easy going. It\'s probably a fun place to be, not to big but there would be a lot of windows. Most of the room would be decorated in a Western theme, full of pictures and awards won by other country artists. Overall it would be a fun,but relaxed atmosphere.

The recording studio might be similar to where I am now because I am in a small room, with a computer and stereo equipment.  My room is different from a recording studio because a recording studio would be much quieter, with more technical equipment all around the room.  The recording studio would be low lit with no windows, microphones and sound recording and munipulating equipment would take up most of the space.  There would be a glass window into room where the artist does the actual recording, it would be very quiet, except for the music playing and the occaisional talk between the sound technicians, the artist and anyone else who is in the room.  There may also be a couch or comfortable chairs in this recording room.  Other people in this room may include the producer or some kind of musical coach, or friends and bandmates of the artist.

1438^CC^O^activity3^The recording came from somewhere in Europe. I`m not exactly sure where Cascada is from. The studio probably had a bunch of sound boards with a lot of dials and there were probably a glass wall that they could see the singer and then adjust the sound. The studio would have a bar stool in a white room which would have a silver doorknob to get into, in the centre would be a black microphone and some headphones. Across the glass the sound booth would be filled with electronic equipment maybe a turntable or two and big speakers. IN this room their would be swivel chairs with a leather covering. This room really differs from my surrounding since it has been a while since I have been in a recording studio or a room just to play music. The buildings could look the same on the exterior though. For the room to be efficient as a recording studio it might have a laptop like mine but other than that the decor and equipment would be total different, mostly because I do not live in a recording studio. Also the room would be smaller because rooms are naturally smaller in Europe when compared to Canadian rooms.   Both of the rooms do have white paint and silver doorknobs my room is carpeted but I don`t think the recording studio would be carpeted. Overall my room and a recording studio are different.

The bagels were made in Toronto, as it is a canadian product. Toronto and ottawa are two similar places, obviously both being in ontario. Usual similar weather the only major difference would be lake ontario bringing toronto different types of weather. I\'m guessing that the soil would probably be a little more rich there, as here we are more on the canadian sheild. Landscape is basically the same, id say maybe a little more flatter in toronto.

A vacation somewhere nice would be lovely .. I wish I could just take a break and go somewhere. Things are probably more relaxed in these nice countries because it\'s easy to spend time outside and very relaxing to laze around or spend your day on the beach. I bet that the plant life and land are beautifully kissed by the sun. Right now it is cold and snowy where I\'m from and I feel sick and tired and always cold myself. I am uncomfortable and I wish that I could visit somewhere nice. The vegetables from my sub probably came from somewhere nice like i just described... the meat probably came from the states or here.. the states is pretty similar to where i am now. And the iced tea is probably just made from sugary syrup and water.. but it is delicious.

Chicken wings come from chickenns obviously, probably from places all around Canada, perhaps more from Ontario or even Ottawa specifically.  I think that it is quite obvious, without going into detail, how chicken wings are made, and where they come from.  I guess wings originate from \"buffalo wings\", therefore in buffalo, which is very similar to here, climate wise and weather wise.  The only difference between there and here, is that buffalo is in a different country.  The people and animals are the very same here and buffalo, and I am sure that chicken wings are not even solely from buffalo, I am simply using this place as a source for this question, but maybe that is the origin of wings.

The mood of the piece is quite depressing as it is \"emo\" music, and I image in recording it the surroundings would have to be somewhat somber.  The place I am in now is not somber, and it is in residence.  There is almost always something going on and very little time for privacy/relaxation.  The building the song was produced in would not be as \"active\".  There would also be different decor in the recording studio in comparison to residence \"decorations\".  I depict the building would also be more \"cheerful\" and the people in it would be eager to work together.

I picture the studio to be dark lighting just so the artist can get in the mood while singing the song. Although the studio area where all the high-tech gagets and music producers are sitting would be well lit, and they would all just be staring at the artist in awe.

This item came from Pizza Pizza, a well known company! Although i am almost certain that pizza originated from Italy along with Pasta. The pizza made from \"Pizza Pizza\" is made right there with any toppings you choose. Most of the vegetables i would assume come from Canada or the U.S. such as mushrooms, onions, tomatoes, etc.     As for pizza itself originating in Italy, I think it is fascinating because pizza is now very popular where i live. It is usually eaten at parties or big get together, or even just a family night when know one feels like cooking.  Pizza now comes in many different forms.You can choose from the type of crust even to the type of sauce such as tomato or sweet chili thai! Its crazy the new ideas people keep coming up with. Pizza is an overall great food to bring people together. Any occasion, pizza can be there.

1386^CC^O^activity3^So, music almost never really fits my mood. At least, when I tell people that my favourite bands are Coldplay and Tool equally, they understand the first but are flabbergasted by the latter, so I\'m not the type of person who is defined by the type of music I listen to, necessarily. But, this past weekend I have definitely been listening to a Tool song that I have become obsessed with called \'H.\'. It\'s off their Aenima CD, which is one of my favourites. Tool is an entirely American band, who recorded the CD also in America, don\'t know where specifically though. I hate geography. But, on a very general level, America is much more individually minded than Canada is. Even Tool has the predisposition to think of individual rights and \"look out for number one\" than say, Coldplay, which are British. However, all songs by Tool are the results of reflections by the band lyricist on the social condition of America, which is from what I\'ve seen on the media--quite racist, isolationist, ethnocentric, arrogant, and afraid of change. Canada is similar in some ways but not nearly as racist, at least from my experience. The lightening for Tool would probably be a little dim, just to get them in the atmosphere so they could really get the emotion out. Speculations of the song say that it\'s about the lead singer\'s son and his history of abuse so I\'m imagining it to be very plain with nothing but the essential instruments and paper. No clue about the building and my house is very colourful so there is absolutely no similarities in the settings.

Milk is a dairy product and there are dairy farmers in order to milk the cows and receive it\'s milk. It is then cleaned and processed and chocolate is added to it in order to create chocolate milk. The milk comes from North America, which is probably about the same climate as there is here. There is no drastic change in the kinds of people or animals around because it is from the same continent, if not country.

1449^NR^O^activity3^Ok, so I ate a sandwich from my cafeteria, so that pretty much explains the rest of this paragraph, no one knows where any of that food came from! Is it even real food is a better question! Alright, I\'ll be serious, lets start with the bread. If i remember correctly, it was Wonderbread...I guess that was made in Canada? I really don\'t know. These questions are hard! I really couldn\'t tell you where any of that food originates from, there were cucumbers, tomatoes, lettuce, turkey, cheese, and ...mayo.  Haha, the turkey could come from my friends farm for all I know?!  The tomatoes and cucumbers could come from my garden back home, which is Prince Edward Island, the soil there is red because of so much iron or something in it.  The landscape is definitely not the same as here!  Not near as many builings there. Anyhow, thats all i can really come up with, because i don\'t know where this food originated from. Sorry!

1394^CC^O^activity3^I listened to a reggaeton song by Daddy Yankee. Reggaeton is a mixture of latin music and hip-hop. This music i believe was intended for all races but its young latin people that embrace it. When i listen to this kind of music i think parties. Where you see \"cool\" people hang out. Girls in mini-skirts, men in baggy jeans, fashionable jewelery, nice cars, and money. I also think of a tropical country. This music is recorded in latin countries such as panama, dominican, puerto rico but also in areas of the united states where the population of latinos is dominant. A record studio recording this type of music i imagine must be very posh. It is common for artists who orginally come from struggling families to show off their wealth in extravegant ways.

1244^CC^O^activity3^I work at American Eagle, where we have a CD sent to us from headquarters that plays on repeat while the store is open.  One song that played was Disturbia, by Rhianna.  This recording comes from somewhere in the United States.  It was created by Rhianna, who is originally from Barbados.  The recording comes from somewhere in the States like Los Angeles, or New York city; a big city where fame is a regular occurance.  It is similar in the sense that many people who live in these places live similar lives to that of the citizens of Ottawa, yet it is different because these types of cities have a much greater scale of fame and fortune.  There are many people who have a lot of money and can thus afford more.  The music studio would be very fancy, considering the fact that Rhianna has made a name for herself over the years.  The lighting would be dim, but not dark.  There wouldn\'t be fluroescent lights, but there would be plenty of lighting to see fine.  The building would be very different than the one I am in right now.  I\'m in my house in the middle of a suburb.  The building would be in a business area where there are also television studios and big name entertainment companies.  There would be the proper equipment there to record songs, and it would be a very posh place.  The studio would have expensive equipment and furniture there to impress their famous clients.

I\'ve seen one video of Alexi Laiho shredding in his studio, and everyone seems pretty relaxed and laid back. It was moderately lit. How should I know what the building looks like? I only saw the inside. And let me tell you, their equipement is a whole lot sweeter than mine. Probably nicer decor too.

To be quite honest...I do not even know where bacon comes from, but I know that I love it. It was cooked in the hotel where we stayed and I wondered where and what it came from. I knew that it most likely came from Canada. Then my friend told me that it comes from the belly of an animal, most likely a pig and how it is cooked. The animal most probably came from a farm where it is fed daily and the climate their is probably warm. However, I never listened or payed attention to this as when I am eating I do not care where the product comes from, just that it is good and can not do any harm to my health.

I thought about the ingredients that were in the sandwich and tried to find out where to buy that type of bread to replicated the sandwich exactly. The lettuce might come from California, in some warm, sunny and dry place. This is way different from where I am now as it is very cold, cloudy and will be wet with snow soon. The landscape in California is very scenic and beautiful, there might be mountains in the background and a body of water nearby. My landscape is relatively flat and uninteresting. People in California are dressed in light clothing whereas here they are bundled up to ward off the cold. Most birds have migrated and animals have started to hibernate. The animal diversity is greater in California because of its warmer climate. There are more animals still alert and roaming around than there are here.

It was basmatti rice that I got from the grocery store but grown in the rice fields in China where it is warm and humid which only resembles Ottawa in the summer. The country of where this food is imported from differs greatly from Canada and I\'m sure the locals who work the land and the rice fields have lives that are worlds apart from the lives we live here in Canada as well. Not familiar with the animals that are indigenous to the landscape but I would imagine they are not the likes of what you would see here in Canada either.

1228^CC^O^activity3^Music that I recently listened to is my highschool band\'s recording of \"To Tame The Perilous Skies.\" It is a \"big band\" song. This includes trumpets and saxophones, etc.   The recording comes from the Christmas concert last year that I performed in. I believe the piece is, however, devoted to the war times. It is supposed to sounds like a battle, back and forth, in the skies.  I don\'t know if the composer is Canadian. I assume, however that the composer is American.   The original recording of this song would have been done in a studio. I have had the chance to record at a studio before. It was very interesting. It was relatively small, but still extremely good quality. The room with all the controls was over-whelming! I don\'t know how one person can understand what everything does in that room. In terms of the lighting, it was relatively the same as an everyday house would be lit. Perhaps a little brighter so that everything is clear in terms of reading music, or perhaps the lyrics if someone needs to read words.   The building looked like a house from the outside. Where I live now (Residence) definitely does NOT look the same as the recording studio that I am thinking of. And there is definitely a different type of decor there. All the walls were lined with guitars, or pictures of guitars, or other musical instruments. It was extremely enlightening, however, to be In such An environment when I was a \"musician\" per se. I enjoyed it very much. I would not like to live in a house that is completely devoted to music, but it was interesting to see an environment that IS completely devoted to music, and the love of it.

1383^NR^O^activity3^So my beverage to focus in on is a staple of any students lifestyle - coffee. It is the most recent thing I\'ve ingested and an experience in which I am about to partake in again as soon as this quiz is over. Where it came from is an interesting query - to be bunt: my coffee maker, after being bought at loblaws, after being packaged by presidents choice, after being picked in some field in south america that belongs to a farmer who quite possibly was underpaid for his work. I\'m one who loves the idea of supporting fair trade workers, and I do in all cases possibly but in the state I\'m at in life, currently a student with an injured foot, I can\'t afford to be so conscientious in every single food purchase I make, neither in a monetary nor temporal sense.   Anyways, back to direct questions, climate of the place where my noble coffee bean orginated? Most likely warm, humid and tropical. I would love to switch places with that coffee bean farmer (not even sure if thats the proper thing to call him or her) at this moment for a little while to escape the perpetual chill of Ottawa. The soil is (hopefully) nowhere near as polluted and poor as the soil one would find around this city, and the lifestyle I imagine to be, in a word, calm. While I don\'t dare underestimate the hard work they do, there has always been something calming to me about getting a product from work with your own two hands. As well any life away from the distraction, and disconnection that comes with modern technology must be calming and exhilarating - or at least it would be to moi.

Sugar I guess isn\'t made in Canada. None of those items really seem like the need to be produced in Canada. It is probably more cost effective to produce them in third world countries. The item is most certainly made. It is probably made in China. Just like everything else in the world. Based on what I learned during the olympics, the weather is warm and muggy sometimes but I feel like it might get cool there too. I don\'t know for sure. I think it is probably pretty different from here. I feel like their climate maybe doesn\'t fluxuate quite so much as here. I would guess that the soil is pretty decent since so much rice is grown there right? I think the landscape is pretty different. Much lower flat lands. Rice paddies. Since I think all people are essentially the same, despite race, ethnicity, physique I would say yes the people are all the same. Plants are different. I know foods are grown there that can\'t be grown quite so easily here like rice. And I think they have pandas. I know they have lots of different animals we don\'t have in Canada. It is practically the other side of the world. Assuming of course that my candycane was produced in Chine like I\'m guessing.

I\'m not sure about which studio it was recorded in, but it was one of the albums recorded after Roger Waters left the band and David Gilmore took over. The music studio could have looked something like the one which The Beatles used. I\'ve seen videos of the studio on TV before. The lighting would be much different, especially if they were getting video footage of the recording, then they would probably have camera lights and stuff. The building would not be the same as mine, it would be much bigger and much more sound-proof. There would be a lot less furniture and a lot more recording equipment.

I\'m not too familiar with how instant noodles exactly are made, but there are some herbs that are inserted into the soup base among preparation, which I\'d imagine are grown on crop fields, just the same as the produces in Canada. I wouldn\'t really have much knowledge on the weather, climate, or the quality of soil, but I do believe that winters contain little to no snow (sparse). In terms of the landscape, I\'d imagine just as in Canada, there are very rural countrysides with very traditional people with strong customs and traditions, but also very urban and dense and lively cities with modern architecture.    I\'m quite fond of South Korea and vow to visit it one day in the short future most definitely. I admire their films, and their culture in general; hence, I\'d imagine the people are just as alluring in reality. As I\'ve barely to anywhere outside of Canada, I wouldn\'t have the least idea what kind of wildlife I would see, but if Asia is any indication, I would be intrigued by seeing what it has to offer.    Unfortunately, I am unable to provide much details in regards to the food - but hopefully what I have provided will suffice, in terms of the study..

Neither is the country of origin or the differences between that country and my own.  Music, at least the kind I find myself considering on a deeper than superficial level, is about emotion.  On the other hand, I do concede that emotionally charged music can depend upon the emotions pervading the place of origin.  For example, regardless of subject matter, the music of Joy Division sounds isolated and far away (as if recorded in an abandoned warehouse), which may be related to the nature of the businesses and familial relations that occur in their part of England.  Having said this, I am not sure that above guide questions are relevant and therefore not something I can answer.

If they are produced on these farms they seem to be really good eggs, haha.  Even if they were produced somewhere outside of the country, I\'m sure the conditions were fairly similar because most chickens need the same conditions to survive.  Even with similar conditions, the landscape and environment could be somewhat different.

People are different, and plants and animals are the same for the most part.

I know that there are raspberry bushes in Canada because their used to be wild raspberries in a field close to my house that me and my Mom would go and pick. I\'m sure the places we get the berries in the winter are from someplace much warmer like California. The weather there must be wonderful. I can\'t image what is would be like wearing a sweater and complaining about the cold when it goes down to 10 degrees celsius. I\'m sure there are a lot of different plants and animals specific to any particular region. I think of sandy beaches and fruit everywhere. Sunshine all of the time and never having any snow. It must be nice not to have to grit your teeth through a winter.

It has a sad kind of aura about it... but it more makes you feel hopeful for something better? or determined? Not sad.  Kind of like where I\'ve been in the last few months I guess, which is probably why it\'s my favourite song of the moment.   I imagine the studio is beautiful.  Shiny. Smooth, clean surfaces.  So that there are no distractions, and everyone can just focus on making the best song possible (which they succeeded in let me tell you).   I think the building would be a lot less comfortable than mine.  Same clean smooth surfaces... but darker... and less personal touches.   Completely different kinds of equipment. Obviously. But like I said, maybe slightly similar decor... dark, slick floors... straight lines.. similar. But different.

It probably came from a multi- billion dollar company since that movie it was put in was highly expensive to make. this place is differnt from where i am now, because it was not made at a school, and was made to go along with a movie to entertain people, rather then to educate them. the building is different because it was not on a campus. the lighting i think would be dim, with fine settings. there would be different decor, but have the same general concept of keeping people comfortable.

I do not think that culturally it would be any different from a canadian recording studio. However, it would probably be a smaller building attached to another building in some urban area. The lighting would be darker than where I am now. I do not own professional music equipment here as they would in a recording studio. The recording studio would have two rooms for the person recording and editing, and for the musicians.     The decor would actually relate to where I am for the reason that they are both plain. It is a place for concentration to record music, as it is for me to do homework so I cannot be distracted.    The setting of a recording studio would not exactly be my idea of a comfortable setting. Here, I can be both comfortable and concentrated.

I really enjoyed the song because of how seamlessly the two were mixed together, especially the guitars, which as a guitar player I really appreciated. I picture that the music company that made the original songs would be quite large, as both bands are well known. As for the person who made the remix, again it is unknown so I would have to assume the studio in which it was made was most likely in a basement on a personal computer. The building could very well be the same as mine, as for all I know it could have been made in a dorm room.

1440^CC^O^activity3^The music I am thinking about is \"The Best Day\" by Taylor Swift. She normally sings songs about love for a boyfriend, but this song is about love for a father. This recording by Taylor Swift is from Nashville, Tennessee. It is from the US, but about seven hours south from where I live near Washington, D.C in Maryland. Tennessee is about the opposite of where I am now in Ottawa, but I think it has some connections. Even though Tennessee is a lot warmer than Ottawa, and the leaves are falling now (like in the lyrics of the song) and it has already started snowing here, this song can bring me to a happy medium point where I appreciate all the seasons. The lighting there is probably not hurting-your-eyes bright, but bright enough that everyone can record without any problems. The record company is probably always looking for ways to improve, but are not cutthroat competitive like other companies. They are probably in a smaller building, only a little bigger than the townhouse I\'m in, but a lot more classier.

When I make pizza I think of Italy, which I guess you could say is the birthplace of pizza. Italy is a beautiful place - I was there when I was 16. It\'s much warmer and more humid, and the buildings can go from ancient history to much more modern, that I remember. The landscape is... a lot hillier.  Depending on how you consider \'kinds of people\', but in attitude, the people are very different. Animals are generally the same, and I don\'t know specifics... But you can get blood oranges there, which you can\'t seem to grow here. Italy is also famous for its Masi wine so I can only presume that the ground is good grape-growing soil - I don\'t know if that\'s more acidic or not.

Once it is fully grown you pull it out of the ground. The climate is very warm and moist, providing good fertile soil for the potato to grow.

It comes from trees, and I guess you can grow apple trees almost anywhere so there is no one specific place that I could really comment on. An apple tree seed is planted and over a number of years the tree will grow healthy and plentiful and eventually healthy apples will grwo from it. Reminds me of when I used to go apple picking with my family when I was young. That was always nice and teh apples were fresh too so we would somtimes pick them and eat them right away. I\'m not really sure where the apple originated, but as I said I am pretty sure it grows almost everywhere that has soil and sun and it is warm, when there is no snow. There would be various sorts of people all around where apple trees are since they grow a many places. And I\'m sure there are also many animals who like to eat the apples if they can get to them, or even eat the fallen apples. I always hated when I saw apples on teh ground that were rotting or stepped on because most of the apples that grow are healthy and those ones have just gone to waste, I feel sort of guilty, for no reason when I see that. I guess it\'s because there are so many people that could eat them, so many who would be grateful. I don\'t know, I never really thought I would be thinking about an apple so much, it\'s interesting what things come up once I actually start to think about it though.

I believe the singer is American.. and it was a country song so I\'m thinking it was probably recorded in Nashville. I imagine Nashville is pretty different from where I am now, lots of accents, cowboy boots and hats. The studio would probably have tons of photos of famous country singers lining the hallways, comfy leather couches, country decor. The lighting would be soft and warm. Maybe some saddles decorating the space. The building is very different from mine, seeing as I\'m in my mother\'s split level house in the city. Very different decor, though I would love it to be country themed. Also very different equipment since the studio would have a ton of soundboards, mikes etc, and all I have here is a desktop and a printer.

They are not completely well known, as they are indie, yet the do have a huge core fan base. it was created in their hometown, as well as in africa, where they committed some of their time for charity work. the people the band worked with are fairly poor, and compared to here, there is a significant amount of poverty apparent. this band provides vocals from a local choir located in africa, and the song is very soothing and full of hope for the future. the music studio within the U.S. is like any other studio, yet when they recorded in africa, they only brought along a microphone and recorder.

Some people may not like their music because it seems too much like noise, but I prefer loud music that lets me drown out the sounds of the rest of the world. I\'m not sure where this music originates from, somewhere in North America, but I\'m not sure of the place the music is talking about. I\'m assuming the recodring studio is like any other, just a regular looking building on the outside with the band inside in a soundproof room. The equipment and lighting wouldn\'t be anything too awkward, just regualr recording devices and microphones. This music I feel is very meaningful to me, but I can\'t place where it may be recorded or what the building is like just by their music.

Its made right here in Canada, in Vancouver actually.  There are many bonuses to using it, its good for your heart and arteries and also good for your skin.  I suppose Vancouver has an ideal climate for growing many natural foods and plants because of the amount of rain and beig the warmest climate in Canada.  The soil must be rich, full of nutrients for the plants, and what I picture is rows upon rows of Flax plants with the Rocky Mountains towering over the fields, protecting them from mother nature.

1476^CC^O^activity3^Last night, I went to a Russian party. This is really the only time I have listened to music recently. It was a lot of Russian pop. I couldn\'t understand anything that the singers were saying, but my Russian friends told me that Russian pop is even more meaningless than English-language pop music. I can only imagine. The recordings must have come from Russia, or some studio in the US or UK, I would guess. The only song that I really listened to is a Russian-language cover of a Farsi song sung by an Indian artist. It sounded really \"Indian\", very Bollywood-style. I really didn\'t like any other song except for this one. I have seen a lot of pieces of different Bollywood films, so I just imagined a whole crowd of White, Russian people in fur hats dancing in snow in a Bollywood formation, men on one side, women on the other.. the main guy trying to seduce the main girl, and she acting all coy. I imagine that the recording was made in the UK or Moscow, let\'s say Moscow... The building would be like any other building, I assume, large, though unassuming, because most of us see tens and hundreds of buildings every day. Recording equipment would be the same as the equipment in any other recording studio in the world. Russia still has a reputation as a dark, recovering-from-communism country. This is true, but Moscow especially has lots of the same consumer goods and materialistic lifestyle that you find in the West or among the upper-class in any other country... so, while the recording equipment might not be the newest, best stuff, it might also have been.

The record is very original and unique, as it blends sci-fi stylings into an atmospheric blend of hip hop beats and stream of consciousness type lyrics.  I can only imagine what the environment of the place of recording is like, as the artist is very eccentric and I suspect draws inspiration from cult pop culture figures, old sci-fi films and B-movies and monster films, medical procedures, and voodoo practices.

1485^NR^O^activity3^Yesterday was the CFL Greycup, and Calgary was in it, so my friend and I decided to have some people over to watch the game and eat some pizza.  We had one pepperoni and one ham/pineapple pizzas.  Both of the pizza have the same basic ingredients.  The pizza were prepared by hand at a local Pizza Hut location.    For the crust and filler they would use flour, probably a product from Western Canada (sask. or man.).  The weather and climate is pretty much the same as it is here in Ottawa.  The landscape would be the main difference.  Those provinces for the most part(especially sask.) are extremely flat.    Tomatoes for the sauce would be from a warmer climate, maybe Mexico Central America or even southern USA.  The climate would be warmer all year round than Ottawa, in order to grow produce like tomatoes.  The soil would be fertile and vegetation in the area would be lust.      Ham and pepperoni would probably be a product of Canada and would come from a pig farm of some sort.  The farm would most likely be in the country, due to the smell.  And could be in any province in Canada.  The weather would be relatively mild and similar to Ottawa.    Pineapples and one of the pizzas would come from a warmer climate.  Possibly Hawaii, they grow lots of pineapples there.  The climate would be moist and very warm most of the year.  The soil would be fertile and moist, due to very damp conditions.  The location is very exotic and very different than that of Ottawa\'s conditions.

I would probably be quite different than the building i live in, as i would doubt he would record in an apartment building. I picture it as being a decent sized house, with a recording studio set up in a spare room or basement. The small studio would have turntables, a computer, recording equipment, soft lighting, maybe there\'s makeshift soundproofing on the walls. There would be ashtrays and bottles strewn about from the late-night jam sessions. The space would have an epic feeling, as though history were made here. Well, that\'s how i imagine it.

The recording probably comes from some fancy studio in LA, with a bunch of people oohing and aahing around John Legend and some hanger-on girls hoping to mabye get with him for just a night. From listening to his schmoozy tunes, he doesn\'t seem like that type of guy but he probably is. Which sounds pretty pessimistic of me. It is pretty different from the University library computer lab I am in right now in many ways. The lighting there would probably be very dim with a single warm light glowing on the artist as he performs, with little twinkles of multicolor lights on the sliding buttons they have in recording studios. The record company is probably more prestigous than someone who records Britney Spears, whos talent consists of whatever computer animated voice they can derive from hers, which isn\'t that impressive... The building could be similar to mine come to think of it, as this is a beautiful University with seemingly limitless corridors and classrooms.

The record company probably works out of some big glass building on the financial district and is full of equipment that i would not know how to use or what to do with it if I saw it.

My grandmother who taught me her recipe called it red velvet cake. The difference between this cake and most other is the amount of melted chocolate and extremely rich texture going in to it. My grandmother is from Germany, which is where she learned the recipe. I\'ve never been there but she describes it to be a very beautiful place. I would imagine weather over there would not be too far off from our own right now, maybe a bit warmer. From what I know, the landscape is quite different from Ottawa, depending on the area of Germany in question. I know some parts are mostly valleys and mountains while others not so much. People there are very courteous and polite (according to my grandmother).

1483^NR^O^activity3^My most recent meal was a ham sandwich, a MacIntosh apple, and a Arizona Fruit Punch beverage. The sandwich was purchased at a student-run store on the Carleton Unicersity campus. It is wrapped in only a peice of clear plastic wrap, without any brand name or information of any kind. The bread, ham, lettuce, cheese (provolone I believe), and mayonnaise could all have been produced here in Canada and I have no reason to suppose that they were not. I suspect the apple was locally grown, since it was a common MacIntosh that I believe is commonly produced in Ontario. As for the beverage, it originates in the United States, where the company is based. The fruit was likely imported from warmer tropical climates. Many Central and South American countries export fruit to the United States. In addition, many of the major North American fruit companies such as Dole operate gigantic fruit farms in Indonesia, Borneo, etc. Some controversy has resulted from their practice of clearing large tracts of virgin rainforest to grow pineapples, mangoes, etc. Apparently, this practice is damaging to native plant and animal life, displaces the native populace, and is a contributing factor to greenhouse gas emmisions as well as soil erosion. Ha! And they laughed when I got a National Geographic subscription!

I would imagine that the recording studio would be a one booth studio with a sleight haze of cigarrette smoke in it. with oldtimy microphones (the suspended ones). the lighting would be a yellow light and slightly dimmed. it would be snowing outside with light flakes. the building would be a brick building, so similar to mine but again, much older. the decor is much different with more nicknacks and more porcaline dodads

1477^NR^O^activity3^For dinner tonight I had a plain old boring salad. All it was was lettuce and dressing. I\'m pretty sure that all of the produce it local. Its grown in the ground. Considering I live on campus at Carleton, I would assume that where the lettuce is grown is a lot different than where I live. I would guess it is grown in an open field or massive garden. I know that lettuce can be grown in our climate so this is why I assume it is local. This being said I think all the people and plants and animals around it are quite like the people, plants and animals that are around me everyday! :)

In china the weather is no where as cold as Canada is so it should be considerably warmer and no snow. I would think canadain soil is healther and there are many differences in the flaura and fauna between the two regions, for example china has panda bears while we have polar bears. The people are obviously different to canadians both culturally and physically.

1406^CC^O^activity3^This song was recorded by an Australian band, and therefore was very similar to North American music.  This place is very similar to Canada (culturally, not in terms of weather of course) so the recording studio and company would be quite similar to ones here.  I would also assume that the decor would be quite different since I live in a quite old neighbourhood and the song consisted of Rock, and therefore the environment in which they enjoy playing is probably not very similar, but, again, the actual recording studio is probably quite similar.  I would assume that this band is not very foreign to my culture and therefore I can relate to the sound of the song more easily.

The popcorn is probably grown at some farm in Canada or the unites states. The corn is harvested after maturity then it must be cleaned and packed away in a bag ready to be used for making pop corn. Where I\'m not it\'s snowing so there isn\'t any corn growing now. Fall is over now so the corn season or harvest is finished. During the corn season harvest, its very cool weather. The soil is cool and cold at nights. The landscape is probably the same because the only difference is the snow that we have gotten. The animals, well the smaller ones, have gone into hibernation for the winter time. People aren\'t outside as much as before they are mainly in their warm houses.

1087^NR^O^activity3^The last thing i ate was a bagel with cream cheese. Now the bagel i believe was made in the country, as that would make the most sense for any baked good. The cream cheese i would believe the same thing, in the country, whereabouts exacle i\'m not entirely sure.  The bagel could be from a factory, therefore weather and climate, as well as soil and landscape wouldn\'t have any particular impact on the making of bagels.  The cream cheese would somehow have to be derived from a dairy farm, as it is a dairy product.  In that case i believe the only thing that may affect the product would be the nutrients absorbed by the animal that produced the milk or whatnot in order to create the cream cheese, but that would only be a small part of it\'s production, as it has to be transformed from it\'s original state as liquid, into cream cheese, which would most likely happen at a factory.  Now seeing as how it most likely were to happen in the country, the kinds of people would be relatively similar: multicultural. The animals owuld be relatively the same, as they would be animals found within Canada.  The kinds of plants would vary depending on the specific climate of the area, that of which i\'m not sure, so I would assume that it would be relatively similar that that of ottawa (minus the large amount of city and so forth, more toward ottawa\'s outskirts) so potentially a countryside as opposed to a city centre.

I also think the tomatoes in the sauce were grown in our country. The pork and beef in the pepperoni were raised on a farm, where as the tomatoes were grown from the ground. My home is in the country, so I\'m used to farms and livestock. Living in residence now, it is a very different environment from where the ingredients in the pizza were made. The weather and climate is the same as where I am now. It is cold and snowy. The landscape is the same. There are more plants and animals in the country. The animals are different. For example, the squirrels are always in the garbage here, but at home they are wild and don\'t rely on humans for food. I also find the people more friendly and laid back in the country.

Most pasta dishes come from italian cuisine, the veggies most likely come from somewhere in the U.S.A, or south america,somewhere hot.Im sure the climate is nothing like where i live, and the soil and landscape must be of great quality for growing purpose of numerous different fruits and vegetables.In the summer i try my best to only purchase local vegetables. All this makes you wonder how many steps it takes for the end result, from start to your dinner table, how many different people handle the products, from country to country, we just purchase the item at the store and bring it home not ever putting a thought into the product.

There are much different decor and equipment there considering my room isn\'t a recording studio.  In the recording studio there would be all the equipment for recording, pictures of famous musicians, and a darker painting scheme.

Fish is easy to catch here in Canada, but probably better in japan. They like to eat seafood a lot, along with places in asia because they are surrounded by water. It probably is healthier as well because they use other ways to cook it. Japanese people are all about healthy food and eating the right proportions. They also find different ways of serving the food with different kinds of food like rice or noodles. Fish is very good and I think everyone should try it.

I would imagiane that all the ingrediants are grown on a farm, in a nice climate that is different from the one that I am in right now. i hope everything in grown on a good farm and not geneticaly altered stuff.     the people would be farm workers who then send all this stuff to the cereal makers, post, kelloges, after it is all ready, pacjaged, and god knows what else they do to it before it is sent out.

Both of these countries are different from Canada in terms of climate and culture. While both places tend to have higher temperatures, both can get cold in its mountainous regions, which are not present in Canada. In South America, there are different animals present, such as alpacas. In India, there are elephants, peacocks, snakes, wild cows, wild dogs etc. It is much more populated than Canada, with greater differences in wealth.

Coffee I believe originated in Ethiopia; however, it is now grown in Columbia, Jamaica, Brazil etc.    It is grown on a shrub which produces red berries and it is the seed inside of these berries that is roasted and then ground into coffee.  It is grown in the tropics (unlike here where the grown is frozen solid and very cold this morning) and on hillsides I believe.    The people there have a much harder life than we do here and their life expectancy is not very high.  They speak Spanish and obviously the Indians Tribes will have their own dialects.  The landscape is mountainous and the animals I believe will be very adept at dealing with this tyoe of terraine - goats etc.

I would like to think it was all organic but that maybe wishful thinking. It had great mandarin oranges and real bacon in it also with a fresh homemade salad dressing. The sald was definately grown somewhere warm , where i live the ground is covered in snow and cold, you cant grow much right now. The place it was grown is very different from where i live right now. Im sure its hot, sunny and full of energy, here it is so cold and sluggish, almost depressing. The soil is rick and is watered by these great sprinkler system that keeps the soil not to wet not to dry. The landscape is flat with some trees.   The only people are the farmers who make sure everything is growing well, and not using pesticides on the different kinds of crops they are growing. I see some bunnies but the farmers let them be, tey have to eat too.  The bacon on the salad came from a full grown organic feed cow that wasnt pumped full of steroids and given lots of room to grow big and strong and not neglected.

1548^CC^O^activity3^I was listening to an Earth, Wind and Fire record on Saturday. I had put it on for my parents because they were visiting and loved it when they were younger. I\'m not sure where the recording comes from, somewhere in the states probably, but what interests me more is where the vinyl itself comes from. We get a lot of our records from thrift stores and garage sales, the odd one from a record or music shop, but most have a longer and richer history than I can probably imagine. I imagine a kid, somewhere, listening to this (or any of our other records) and loving this piece of vinyl intensely. Being really passionate about this piece of music and this record and even the cover. I love how well it\'s clearly been loved. I\'m not sure of the history behind the music or the band, I don\'t know much about them at all but I imagine that they recorded it in a pretty plain building in a pretty basic recording studio without a whole lot of flash. I doubt they were the kind of band to be really picky about things like that - some good quality equipment and they could do it on their own. I don\'t know, this exercise might be easier if I was thinking about modern music - it\'s easier to imagine the recording studios of bands and performers that you see on much music or any of their reality shows. I can\'t imagine the personalities and quirks of the E, W, & F guys.

Today, when I woke up Taylor Swift was singing her song \"Love Song.\"  Taylor Swift is an American country pop singer. I imagine that the recording studio in the United States was very similar to that used for Canadian videos in terms of the building, lighting and the equipment used.  The only difference is that because Taylor Swift is such a successful pop star, she may have had a larger budget to work with compared with many Canadian singers.

1549^NR^O^activity3^The meal that I ate most recently was a conglomeration of some leftovers I had in the fridge, some ground beef and a Sidekicks prepared meal. I made the Sidekick for dinner, but I like to cook and didn\'t just want to have a boring old packaged meal. I don\'t have a lot of food on hand so Sidekicks was really the only choice, s I fried up some garlic and onions while I searched for something else to throw in there. I de-frosted some ground beef and fried that up with the garlic and onions to put in with the packaged meal to add some spice to it.       The Sidekick is a generic packaged food product from a factory somewhere, nowhere exotic I\'m sure. The ground beef is Canadian, probably from out West and the garlic and onion could\'ve come from anywhere, although I presume locally for cost factors. It wasn\'t so much about where the food came from though that made the meal kind of unique for me, it was the fact that I was trying something new, in some new combination of foods that made it exciting.        Also, for lunch I had an avocado and an apple (along with my sandwich). I recently read a book about the different types of fruits and vegetables we\'ve domesticated, and about all the different types of each fruit and vegetable there are. I\'ve never really thought much about types of apples I eat, but I generally buy Granny Smith apples because I like them, but this time I bought a different kind (although I can\'t remember which kind or where they came from). I did think about it though at lunch when I was eating the apple, it was very different, very sweet. I plan on trying different types of apples (in particular, but I\'m sure other fruits as well) in the future, and hopefully learning about where they come from.

1543^NR^O^activity3^I had an orange with my breakfast this morning. I\'m not sure where it came from but at this time of year, it was probably either Florida or California. Oranges grow on trees, which seems self evident but is a bit strange to see in person. I guess we\'re not used to seeing things that big grow on trees. When I picked them once it was a bit unbelievable and surreal. Not sure about the soil conditions but since this orange wasn\'t organically grown I imagine the soil was pretty devoid of living organisms and chock full of fertilizers and pesticides. Kinda makes me want to go out and get some organic produce!     The climate in the southern US is quite a bit different than here of course. A lot warmer and in California, a lot drier. Both of those climates would be a welcome treat right now since it is minus 14 out today. Then again I probably wouldn\'t appreciate those beautiful warm days without the contrast. Thinking of California   reminds me of the fabulous seaside drives, old Spanish missions and the ever present palm trees. The whole landscape seems alien and yet strangely beautiful.  People are different too. Many more Hispanics and African Americans. It seems all the gorgeous women in America migrate there as well. Always struck by the greater contrast, in the US compared to here, of wealth and poverty. Driving through the concrete jungles is a frightening thing. The animals that live in warmer climates are quite a bit more threatening than those here. There are many poisonous reptiles and insects to be on the lookout for.

My husband made it who is an amazing chef, it was delicious and had a lot of love in it! The vegetables were sourced locally and were fresh and beautiful, although the letuce was slightly wilted. The weather and climate where it was grown would be similar to here, which means they are probably suffering from the heatwave as we are. Dennis made the hollandaise sauce fresh with room temperature butter.

1601^NR^O^activity3^I recently enjoyed a meal of courgette, onion and hollandaise sauce. I chopped the courgette into rounds and sliced the onion. I sauted the onion in a little olive oil, added a shake of garlic salt then tossed in the courgette. The trick is to heat the vegetables through thoroughly without making them soft.   When they were browing  slightly I put them on a plate and poured over hollandise sauce. I used a packet, although I usually make all my foods fresh.  With this I had some fresh cherry tomatoes which I took off the vine as I needed them (I ate outside).   The courgette was given to me by my landlady who grew it about 300 metres away from my house. The tomatoes were (obviously) grown by me, in a tub on my deck.  Not sure where the onions came from :-)  I sat in the sun and enjoyed this meal and listened to the birds, what I could hear above the deafening cacophony of cicadas.  When I first came to live here, the noise of cicadas used to get on my nerves but I love it now; it\'s the sound summer.  This is a semi-tropical area, so we never get snow but living in the foothills of the Waitakere Ranges, we probably get a little more rain than other areas. That\'s fine, we have pristine rain forest which we value and preserve.  Very few places will have the same plants and animals that are found here. Many of our species are unique.    When I am eating, I generally think about people who don\'t have the food and water privileges I have. At the moment I wonder how they are managing in Gaza and other war-torn places.  Because I was once so poor that I couldn\'t afford to feed my children, I remember what it was like for me and that brings gratitude that we all survived and prospered. But I never take anything for granted and whenever I can, I share.

1602^CC^O^activity3^I listened to \"Up in the Canyon\", a song from Burton Cummings\' latest cd \"Above the Ground\".  The recording was done at a studio in L.A., California, a much sunnier locale than Vancouver, even in January when most of the cd was recorded. The population in the U.S. is much greater than ours here in Canada; however, the studio could have been located just about anywhere.  I don\'t think it is unlike recording studios here.  There are a few easy chairs in a lounge area and a lot of technical sound equipment in the studio. It\'s a work environment; my space at home is much more conducive to relaxation and \"down time\". Studios are intense places where musicians record over and over until whoever is in charge feel its right. The song, \"Up in the Canyon\" is about a location in a suburban part of L.A.  Burton sings about how he stays home instead of joining people at a BBQ up in the canyon. He doesn\'t care to be there; doesn\'t relish the phoniness, just wants to stay home.

Minced garlic (from a jar), pork mince, beef mince, brown onions, some olive oil, a jar of flavoured tomato puree, a tin of diced tomatoes.    The beef comes from farms in NSW, where I live.  NSW is a big place.  The beef farms are usually inland, across the mountains.  I\'ve been to many of the cattle areas of NSW, and I\'ve studied agriculture for about seven years so I have a basic idea of how it all works.  The areas are hot and dry, and dusty.  Cattle farms tend to be pretty low on grass, mostly scrubby grass.  It\'s largely flat lands - better for cattle.

1632^CC^O^activity3^This recording comes from the United States, by a popular female artist. I\'m not sure if she helped write the song or not, but it is a very relatable tune/lyrics for many female listeners. I\'m sure that there are a lot of similarities between Canada and the U.S.; however there are several differences as well. I don\'t really know what the recording company would be like because I\'ve never visited such a place before; only seen them depicted in movies or on TV. I\'ve seen artists singing inside a box, into a large microphone, with headphones on their ears. Sometimes they are singing solo, sometimes they are singing with someone else. Sometimes they are with the band, sometimes they are singing to music that\'s already been recorded. The lighting is usually rather muted from what I\'ve seen depicted; they seem to want a relaxing atmosphere where the singer can feel comfortable. The buildings where these recording studios are located have varied from very large structures to smaller more intimate, \"cozier\" settings that are owned by the particular artist/musician. There are usually many types of equipment ranging from musical instruments to recording devices, computers, etc. Lots of buttons and complicated looking equipment! If the artist owns the particular studio there is usually something there to make \"their own\" and personalize it, whether it be the decor like the paint colour, the furniture or the artwork hanging on the walls.  The similarities between the recording studio and my own livingroom where I currently am at the moment are that it\'s a comfortable space. I have added things that make it personal to me; favourite paint colour on the walls, comfortable furniture and nice things hanging on the walls and photos of family & friends around. The lighting is somewhat dim while watching TV or surfing the internet, but it\'s brighter when reading or doing something that requires detail. Lighting definitely can help set a mood.

The cereal is made from wheat and oats and honey and sugar, and I\'m not sure where these all come from. I\'d like to imagine that the sugar comes from Brazil because I\'d like to think of Brazil, even though it\'s even more humid there. Maybe because then I think of beautiful sand and palm trees and the warm water of the ocean. All the rest of it probably comes from somewhere in the midwest, which I always think of as windy. I imagine that the soil is very brown and not too try and not wet. Moist, maybe. There must be very big machinary that takes care of lots of the growing parts now.

1636^CC^O^activity3^American Pie  I would have to say America is where this song comes from. However the name of the person or persons responsible escapes me now. Even though I think the song comes from America, that doesn’t actually mean that the song was literally recorded there. The place the recording originates from would be very similar to where I am. First our countries are neighbors, second there is a theory that Canada, where I’m from, patterns itself on the US. I think that it would be safe to say we are at the same levels in the food chain.  With regards to the music studio, I think it might have a room in a house somewhere. Someplace where the people recording could hang out and relax. The lighting might have been subdued; anything fierce wouldn’t have worked for putting the recording artists at ease. As the song was recorded quite awhile ago, the record company might not have been considered the man hungry shark that most companies in the music business are considered today. The building would have been nothing like mine. I currently am sitting in a community college that is very tech advanced, in the middle of a large city and the building itself is considered very “green”. The studio was probably in a house, someplace secluded, where the builders knew nothing about being green and the people who owned it had it luxury-filled to the max. So no, the building was most defiantly not like mine. But as my school offers a music arts program, there would similarities with regards to music recording equipment, just the technology would be different.

It is a city built on sand on a grand scale. It has lowly paid workers who work hard and send their money back home to their families. It is hot most of the year and there is little rain. The soil is sand, unless it has been enriched. In New Zealand the country is green. The people here are of quite different descent from the people in New Zealand, who are mainly polynesian and from england, scotland, ireland.   The landscape is very different here- sandunes, and in Dubai big buildings with over the top architecture, like the terminal I am sitting in as I type. In New Zealand each of the big cities has some highrises, but nothing like this- not the marble, and the tiles and the parquet flooring.

It will have been baked here in the city, and many of the ingredients are probably local. The chocolate, however, will be from another country as there is no chocolate grown in New Zealand. Most likely the chocoate would have come from either South America or Africa, but I have no way of knowing specifically where. It would definitely be hotter there, since I believe that cacau plants need hotter weather than we have in New Zealand. I would guess that the soil, weather, climate and landscape would all be significantly different to New Zealand. The people, plants and animals would all be different too.

1682^CC^O^activity3^The music is an album by Evren Ozan, child prodigy. It\'s Native American flute music recorded in New Hampshire, USA. I know nothing of this state other than it\'s in a part of the country that snows (it doesn\'t here where I live) and I know nothing of recording studios other than what I\'ve seen on television. The buildings would be the same as far as a roof, floor, and walls but what each of those are made of depends on the location of the building and the use of the building. I don\'t imagine it would be like my home. I picture someone in a control room watching the musicians through a transparent wall or window. I imagine the lighting would fit the mood of the musicians, just like I do here at home. I do not live in a recording studio nor do I have many musical instruments here at my home and in no way have the many instruments used in this recording. I read the cover of the CD and discovered that there are instruments I\'m not even familiar with.  I listen to this album to relax and re-energize. The music not only relaxes me it transforms me. When I close my eyes and listen I cease to be indoors. I feel my spirit soar, dance, skip, twirl, float and fly through meadows, mountains, forests, deserts, flat terrain and hills. There are no limits.  Doing this activity seems to put restraints on that process. Where the music begins (the recording studio) does not limit where it can go or what it can do. Why not think of where it really begins, in the mind and soul of the young man who wrote the music and was able to express it though musical instruments? To me, that is magic.

While the pasta we used was manufactured here in NZ, pasta originates in italy, which although on the other side of the world does share some similarities with NZ. In the cities its very different - the number of people is much larger in italy, however the thought of being surrounded by so much history around every corner is something which is amazing to me.

I am not sure where they originated from but, my guess would be Africa - since they seem to be a staple for monkeys and that is where monkeys come from.  I have never been to Africa but, I would like to go very much.  I hear that the beaches in Mozambique are the most beautiful in the world.  The jungles look fascinating and the Mountains are grand.  Taos does not have beaches or jungles.  THE soil in the low lands in dry - not unlike our own.  I do not know what the climate in all of Africa is like.  I only know that in some places it is very hot and that there is a rainy season that all the animals (elephants, antelope, Zebra, Monkeys, water Buffalo, ect) depend on to survive.  The landscape is vast and various.  The people, I assume, are kind and curious.

1778^CC^O^activity3^The recording came from a country other than mine.  The place the recording came from is somewhat different than the place I am in, in the sense of atmosphere, weather and resources.  I think the music studio is probably a quiet, vast and elegantly dark area where the singer can freely transmit what they want to express without a lot of chaos in the studio.  The lighting would not be overly bright and instead be moody looking so the artist may feel in tune with its artistic implications.  I think the decor is probably fairly simple, as opposed to stuff all over the walls and in this regard, it is similar my surroundings and the equipment is definitely different than my own because I do not have the kind of electronic equipment that is found in a studio.

I always think of a stage like you see on TV shows in Vegas with a big dinner crowd and a stage show, with Neil Dimond leading the way... seems like a fun way to spend an evening, and the song is fun. This type of music is fun and inspires dancing! Reminds me of costume partys have been too, that are themed, 60/ & 70\'s music is so much more fun to dance too and most people recognise them and will become less inhibitate and sing & dance with or without drinks. I have no idea about its true origin or history. Just the hstory it reminds me of and that usually involves fun friend and dancing & singing.    I think the last time I went out and had this song as part of the party, was on a river boat dinner cruise where me & my girlfriends had done a 10 km race in the mornign then gone out for a girls night dinner and we ended up getting the entire boat up dancing & singing! I was stone cold sober due to a stomach bug, but no one would have known the difference & I still had a blast - girls weekends rule. still tryingto have one this year even with the new arrival. she will learn to work in with mum\'s mad events!

I think coffee is from South America originally, where it is hot and sunny sometimes, but also rainy, like in the Amazon. NZ isn\'t much different. I would imagine the soil would be richer in Sth America. Landscape would be similar but with different vegetation and more animals. NZ only has birds and lizards, really. Different people, more culture, hotter, more poisonous things.

It\'s a quirky piece so has nothing in common with where I am now or what I am doing but is easy to sing along to and all my colleagues know it so we occasionally break out into a few bars of it. The artist is very out there and futiristic looking so imagine the record company that produces this music has lots of money and plans for the future. They\'s have the best technology and the best of everything. I think the lighting there would be pretty stark which is not what my home is like. My home and this record company would have nothing in common.

We should probably be able to make all of our food that we need in New Zealand - there\'s not that many peope to feed and we have excellent soil and growing conditions. The vegetables I ate were all NZ grown, although the tomatoes were froma tin.

1803^NR^O^activity3^Lately I have been eating a lot of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and thinking that they are great, but that they are not helping in my quest to lose weight.    The peanuts come from overseas I assume and are probably grown in a non organic manner as it is a bulk supply/demand item. I am not really sure about their origin or their journey and should really pay more attention to the foods that I ingest.

1822^CC^O^activity3^This recording come from the UK. It was created by Enya, on the other side of the world, where Summer is Winter. The company might be rather open for all music types, anyone could walk in and produce a soundtrack. The lighting would have a distant warm glow that relaxs the composer/singer. The doesn\'t have carpet though. Unlike my building there aren\'t windows that overlook the hills and blue sky. The decor would be 70s and outdated, the burnt orange furniture moulded by so many bottoms.

1849^NR^O^activity3^some of the food was made/ grown here. Especially the salad ingredients and the meat. The meat is made of tortured animals raised in appalling condtions most likely. We don\'t think about that when we are enjoying food. The vegetables will be grown in market gardens on an industrial scale. When I think about the conditions of the prodcution of food it is not reassuring. It makes me feel a little uncomfortable. I don\'t usually think in this way about food.The carbohydrate (rice)in the food would be fronm a tropical country such as Thailand or somewhere where it might also be grown under factory conditions. It would be pleasant to imagine it grown by happy peasants but that isn\'t very likely. Rice couldn\'t be grown in a cold climate like here so it must be imported. Any animals in a  rice farm would be working animals or pests I imagine.

1821^NR^O^activity3^My breakfast-I\'m not sure what own or country but ihad eggs which i know comes from a chicken. I think it is grown in nz.From chickens they wern\'t free range but they wern\'t battery chicken eggs i think barn laid. I would say a whle lot of chickens in a barn that get to run around a are a bit freerer than battery chickens but no where near as free as free range chickens. I\'m not a chicken so. Will be hot and no freesh air. No Soil. no. NO
