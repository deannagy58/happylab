It felt like a blanket wrapped around me, comforting. As I walked and felt this air I really didn\'t think or feel very much and perhaps that was what was so comforting.

1093^NR^O^activity2^I am thinking about my old cabin on the river.  It has been 2 years since I have been there but I bring myself back to it often.  I imagine having my coffee sitting on the dock in the morning.  The river is like glass or some days it is moving quickly.  I remember the geese landing there in flocks of hundreds.  It was always peaceful and always changing.  I would watch leaves falling into the river in autumn and the harvest moon rising on the river. The moon was breathtaking. I remember great expanses of sky.  I could see a far distance down the river.  This was awesome and inspiring.  I remember cross country skiing there in the winter.  I would watch the frozen river on winter nights in the cabin.  I would walk the frozen river to the provincial park next door.  I would walk my dog on the frozen river.  He was a beautiful quiet companion.  I felt peaceful, relaxed and connected in this place throughout all seasons, throughout all troubles in my life.  I would chop and pile wood outdoors.  I felt alive.  I felt isolated but comfortable.  The best word to describe it would be peaceful.  I felt alive there.  I enjoyed seeing the birds: the herons; the cardinals, the bluejays, the owl who came many mornings and sat in the tree.  I could see the stars, the Big Dipper in my bed room window.  On some evenings I could see the Northern Lights.  I felt connected and happy and free and part of the universe.  I still go on nature walks when I can, in city parks and nature trails however as a woman, it is not safe to walk in these areas so it never brings back those feelings of peace and freedom.  You cannot feel free when you are afraid.  Nature is a a part of my heart.  My heart is alive when I am outdoors.

1087^NR^O^activity2^Recently I went for a walk around my neighbourhood for the main purpose of walking my dogs. I didn\'t really notice all that much as i recently had my wisdom teeth removed and so i\'ve spent the past week in a considerable amount of pain. While I was outside i noticed that it wasn\'t particularly quiet though it was around 9 o\'clock at night, and then with the constant whining and panting of my dogs it was difficult really to focus on anything.  So altogether, it was really difficult to notice anything with the compilation of tooth pain, dog whining and panting, and distraction in general as to what was going on around me.

1122^CC^O^activity2^I spent my time in my bedroom on campus and noticed stale air and cement walls. I began to feel somewhat isolated and so l closed my eyes and tried to think of my bedroom at home and how the sense of having my family close made me happier. As i began to think of home I started to relax and stopped thinking about all the work that is stressing me out and just had a moment of peace. It really did not last very long as my mind began to wonder and I started thinking about my mom and her sickness and how i could help her. I can\'t really seem to stay balanced now a days with family problems on my mind, but the attempt to relax was something different for me. I think i may need to find another place to relax though because my room seems to instigate a feeling of isolation. Every now and than i could here my flat mates going in and out of the door, which for some reason made me uneasy. I usually don\'t notice the background noises but during this time everything stood out and I had a tendency to pay attention to it during my silent time.

It is calm with the nature all around but unfortunatly I dont get to go very often because I am so busy with school and work. On days I feel anxious I try to go there but it doesnt have the same effects when I have to plan time to go because I\'m aware of the other things I should be doing during that free time. Many time when I have large tests I go there to study because it is peaceful and I am able to concentrate fully and clear my mind, making it easier for me to remember the material. Other times when im there I think about things that are bothering me. During those times I often feel alone because it is a very secluded place. When this happens I usually call a friend or go somewhere where I am still able to be alone but I still recieve the comfort of other people around such as a mall or grovery store.

Everything was familiar so I had the security of knowing where everything was and that made me feel like there was nothing to worry about.  I took in my surroundings and I realized that my dorm room was really empty so then I decided to call up my friend to bring over some magazines and I decided to cut out pictures and decorate my walls. It took my about 3 hours to do all my walls and now they look great. My dorm room feels more like home now instead of just white walls a ll over the place. After doing this task I felt really proud of myself. I then just started moving my room around. I moved my fish tank and my shelves and my bed. I just needed to keep busy but the end result was amazing. I love my room now. It was my safe haven before but now even more so. I noticed that I have a lot more room to move around in. This day I felt happy, energized and really at ease and peaceful. I always feel peaceful when everything goes as I planned.

I noticed the birds, there was a chipmunk playing with some nuts near the pool, a rabbit was playing on the golf course. While I was laying there I was thinking about everything that has gone on between my boyfriend and Id uring the last six months, the lies he\'s told, the deceptions, and him not treating me right, and I was thinking if he really meant that if I gave him one more chance he would prove to me he wasn\'t like that.  It\'s very frustrating, the situation he\'s put me in, because I feel very unappreciated, taken for granted, heart broken, and angry. I\'m really angry, which for me is a weird feeling cause you have to do a lot to get me angry. So we\'ll see what happens. I sat out there for a few minutes thinking until my thoughts were interuppted by his little brother.

Thinking aimlessly of what happened during the day, thoughts of solitude, and loneliness while thinking about my significant other but at the same time i was happy, and content knowing that i have them in my life.. while pondering i would stare at a wall or out the window watching the leafs fall from the trees outside watching where they landed. I noticed dust building up on the window cil, and wiped it away. I compared the walls around me and the textures. i could feel my blankets becoming warmer, I hugged my pillow, and suddenly I wasnt lonely anymore, i felt like my loved one was there with me. i closed my eyes and she was, I envisioned laying with her holding her.

1144^CC^O^activity2^It was a couple of nights ago.  I had just come in from Montreal, visiting some friends and family.  The US Presidential election was coming to a close on the nearby television set; within a half an hour, Senator Obama had become the new President-elect.  I immediately felt joy and comfort knowing that a black man such as myself can obtain the highest position in the West through hard work and determination.  My family was celebrating; I called some friends to talk to them about what had happened.  It was near midnight, but all the lights in the house were on.  The thought of somebody winning something so momentous instantly made me think of a woman I care for greatly.  If a black man can become the President of the US, then, I thought, I could surely overcome my nerves and approach her with my true feelings.    Yeah... that\'s about it haha.

When we first moved here, it was all white, dirty, hardly any furniture, and in need of quite a bit of repairs/updates. Since September we have worked many hours painting, buying furniture, and general house updates ( mirrors, towels, hardware). Also, this is the first time that i have lived on my own...  so when i realized how much of an improvement there was i felt proud, a sence of accomplishment, and thought i had a great start to my new life. I thought about how other people may start off on their own, how they might have spent some of their money. In all truth, i felt i did it right. I am thrilled to come HOME, and have a sence of stability.

1095^NR^O^activity2^I was walking along the path along the Rideau with my boyfriend on the weekend. I noticed the water, there was calm water and water rushing into the canal out of an opening in the cement. There was an old boat that was kind of beat up looking but still neat to look at. There were ducks in the water swiming in packs and there was spots of snow but mostly only on the other side of the canal. The sun was very bright and very warm. There were fallen leaves on the ground everywhere. It was nice because I was off of campus and away from everything but I could still see it like I was looking in on it from the outside. There was a lot of slimy moss on the sides of the canal and on the rocks. The water was fairly shallow and I could see the bottom in most places. This made me wonder how that old beat up boat could get in and out of there. I noticed the wind as well it was really windy and blew my hair in my face. This wind also made it fairly cold and my ears and fingers started to get cold but I didn\'t mind it. I was thinking about how lucky I am to experience things like this and things of this beauty. I was thinking about how lucky I was to be with my boyfriend, and to have someone I love and who loves me. It made me feel relaxed and in a sense took me away from frustrations and worries of university life. It all just gave me a break and made me feel at ease.

I just sat and listened, and tried not to think about anything. It was difficult at first as there is alot going on in my life, work and school and busy times. I tried to push all thoughts of school aside because they generally tend to stress me out. I sat there and listened and thought about the summer time, when my friends and I spent a week camping by a lake in a remote area out in the country. We had food, guitars and each other for one week and had the time of our lives. Thinking about that and listening to the music made me a little sad, as many of those friends are in other cities at other schools, but it also made me happy to remember such good times.

1123^NR^O^activity2^A few weeks ago, I walked my father\'s girlfriend\'s dog; his name is Buddy. I used to take him to the park beside the canal, and I remember we\'d have to walk a block to get there. I would look out into the street, and all the leaves, it seemed, were yellow and dropping, or dropped. I looked down at my feet moving, and then over to Buddy, who\'s a big, chocolate lab, and we\'d pause as he\'d sniff around for a while. While he did that, I would look out at the houses, and everything was doused in the late afternoon light (this was before daylight savings time had been close), and then we\'d continue. I recall a white fence, and the grass was very green, although it was late October. I\'d look at the tinted windows of cars, and of the dog park in the distance. It seemed on those walks I\'d notice the most of other dog walkers. Buddy has arthritis, and finds it hard to walk for long periods of time, and I could hear him panting. I was on the right side of the street, and I\'d cross diagonally toward the bicycle path opposite us. The canal looked glossed and mirrored the building across from us, and everything it seemed, stopped. For a while, until someone would walk by, or a car would park near us.     Sometimes I would sit, and stay there for a while, and Buddy would lay beside me. When he\'d look up at me, it was pretty obvious he was finished, so we\'d leave for home. We\'d continue along the block, coming home from the other side of the street. The city transit would go by, and I\'d let Buddy continue along the patches of grass which were sort of scarce. During this time of day, that side of the block is shadowed. The greens are spinached and oily, and the pavement is a dirty grey. The street always seemed longer.     And then we\'d be done.

The sun is beating down on my face, making me feel nice and warm. There is a nice breeze that comes and goes, cooling you off when it hits you. I was thinking about how it was such a beautiful day and definately taking advantage of it before the snow and winter comes. The grass is showing again after the first small snowfall we had and it\'s so nice to see it again. I wish it was always like this in Canada. Makes me want to live somewhere where it\'s warm all year, but then I would miss everything else about Canada. The odd seagull would fly around and then go to a garbage in search for something to eat. Made me think about how beautiful a country we live in and how the earth is such a neat thing and so complex. To look at the beautiful trees and just the landscape of it all. To see everybody else walking in a hurry, not even paying attention to something so beautiful and wonderful. I wondered if people had actually had the same thoughts that I had had about our country and the environment. As I left the warm sunshine and nice fall breeze on my way to class, I hoped that this weather would stay much longer and that I would have yet another to enjoy it before the cold long winter came.

1130^CC^O^activity2^I went to my parents house. My room is still there. I love my room so much. I sat there and looked around and thought of this study. I am happy when in the room, yet sad becuase I will be leaving it to go back to my apartment in ottawa.     I realized that the room was a true reflection of my personality. It looks like a mixture of a 5, 10, 15, and 30 year olds room. I am grown but love stuffed toys still. I guess what I realy thought of was that it is the only place that is truly me, and shows the real me with no bias.     I noticed all the littel thigns that maen something to me, and were I got each thing. I hope my room never changes, I will not give up the room eventhough I do not live there anymore.     I think that everyone should have a place like that, it does not need to be big or fancy, just be a place that represents you as you truly are and not what people want you to be.

I also noticed the sound of the water and the birds chirping. I felt very calm sitting by the canal, my mind was really blank i wasn\'t experiencing any deep emotions or thoughts. I was just calm and content.

1101^NR^O^activity2^An outdoor naturalistic place I usually go to, is the auberidum. It is a very peaceful place, where joggers, bikers or dog walkers usually go. I brought my sheltie, and went to go sit down, in my usual spot, near a little stream, and a really big maple tree. I decided to go becasue my dog loves to run around freely there, and I also love the scenery. Its a place where you can relax, take a little nap with no worries to think about. I felt calm, happy, and peacful while being there. Most of the time, I was just watching my dog run around and playing with the other dogs. But while watching blankly, I was just thinking about little things here and there; such as, how peaceful it was there, and how I should do this more often. I feel when your around nature, you are happier, calmer and more relaxed versus if you are somewhere with alot of stuff going on. Most aspects that I noticed there were the beautiful trees, with bright leave on them, and I just love seeing all the dogs running around and enjoying themselves. After an hour of being there, I started thinking about more things that were going on in my life, such as school, things at home and friends. I started thinking about how much has changed since highschool, and about my future. Even though I was thinking about extremely important aspects, I was still calm and happy. I try to go there atleast once every two weeks, its just hard, since school takes up most of my time.

1158^CC^O^activity2^When relaxing, I\'m usually in my dorm in residence. I\'m usually thinking about school, reading required texts for school or watching tv.  I feel relaxed but not at home when I\'m here. I don\'t really sit here in silence, there is always something on; either music, or the tv.  If there is silence it is because I am sleeping. Residence is a friendly place but not somewhere I would choose to live for the entire 4 years of university. I am looking forward to getting a place off campus next year.

1152^CC^O^activity2^I see the couch in my living room. The soft leather cushions, warm glow of a light and the curtains closed provide a momentary peacefulness. NO noise, no kids, no work, nothing. I feel the weight of my body sink in to the cushions…exhaustion.  This feeling is simultaneously met with guilt, and resentment for the reaming task of the day homework, dishes, and other chores. I then think FU** it just want to stop and I can’t wait until this degree is finished

1178^CC^O^activity2^I felt comfortable and relaxed. I was able to become immersed in thought. I noticed the walls around me and the lighting. I noticed the dust on the ground and furntiture. I focused mostly on teh bookcase.  I spent most of the time thinking rather than observing my surroundings. I thought about the school work and house work I had to do. Specifically catching up on my psychology classes before the midterm this weekend. This made me feel anxious. I thought about a complicated romantic relationship I am currently involved in. That made me feel a range of emotions: happy, nervous, guilty and hopeful. I thought about my relationship with a particular friend. I felt upset and bitter because this person has back-stabbed me. I also drifted into fantasies. I thought of an old friend I had not seen in a long time. I missed her and wanted to get in contact with her.

I felt really happy not haveing to worry about anything, i just sat there.  I looked at everything in the room, the walls, all the pictures, the fire, the cats playing around on the floor, I just kina stared at everything around me.... because I was just there to relaxe I could just sit there and take it all in.

1090^CC^O^activity2^Recently, I have spent time in a hotel room in Niagara Falls to relax and get some work done.  I felt undistracted and free to do what I wanted.  I noticed the room, even with all of the lights on had low lighting.  It was nice to feel that I was not responsible to clean up or take care of the room.  It was also nice to be alone to do work at a pace chosen by me since the due date is not for another week and I had no pressures from anyone rushing me.  I was also nice not having anyone pressuring me to do anything or feeling guilty for something I was doing or not doing.  I spent time letting my mind wander - about my current relationship, my family circumstances and goals I wanted to accomplish over the next year (frequent thoughts I have).  It was relieving to be able to mull these ideas around without others contributing their opinions for once.  I usually feel pressured by others to do what they want me to do, but I felt this time was my time to figure out exactly how I felt about these issues.  I am so happy in my current relationship although it bothers me that some of his past flames are around.  I still haven\'t figured out how I feel about family circumstances pointedly however it was beneficial to be able to think about all the differnt aspects playing into this confusion - cancer, divorce, infedelity, alcohol, people trying to force me to forget what has happened.  I also spent some time planning what I want to accomplish in the next year from financial issues, to how to travel a bit and where I wanted to go.  I also thought about how it is rewarding, thus far, to be back in school, although only part-time and to be doing well again as I didn\'t in my last year enrolled at The University of Western Ontario.  Admittedly, although I didn\'t necessarily want to think about it,  I thought about my weight.  I am thinner than I was about 4 months ago due to digestive problems due to anxiety, however, even though it may not be healthy, I am slowly getting happier with how my body is looking.

1183^NR^O^activity2^Yesterday was a beautiful sunny day, especially for this time of year. I\'d spent most of the day reading, watching a video lecture and making notes, with only a few short breaks to do the chores at the barn, mess around in the garden a bit, so after i made my early supper i decided to sit out in the front yard and eat it before heading off to my evening job. It\'s quite stressful at work right now with my co-facilitator embroiled in a legal dispute and several of the group members facing tough challenges so i needed to get centered. The view across the valley was crystal clear. I could see Millers sawmill miles away on the other high bank of the Mississippi and there were still patches of colour among the pines and firs that poked up above the maple and birch. The skeletal sunflowers framed the view out over the garden and \'cross the valley and a bit of smoke came out of Bill and Molly\'s chimney down the hill. The monkshood still held it\'s frozen blue blooms under the russian olive and the tufts of tangutica festooned the woodshed like a million mad einstein hairdos. The garlic beds stood proudly planted and the last few kale stood stalwartly green in the barren brown of fall gardens. I sat and ate and soaked it in. The chickadees came one by one to the feeder and some other bird that seemed happiest standing upside down(nuthatch...flicker?)...they flew nervously in to the feeder one at a time, occasionally squabbling if they thought their turn had been usurped, taking no more than four pecks at the seed and then scooting out of the way of the next incoming flight. It seemed that one of the chickadees with a slightly reddish belly only ever took two pecks before flying off.

With a sprained ankle and arm, no place seems comfortable. This place tries so hard to make me happy, and i know i am happier here than i would be anywhere else. I know that it is not its fault that i feel unhappy for the past week. It is the fault of my own, for spraining myself. I am still at home, but this home is too famiilar. I wish that i could leave for a short while, and come back to truly appreciate the beauty of my home. I know that in a week I will feel happier in this place than i do now. I know that the beauty will return, and i will once again be at home.

I went to Rideu Center to buy a shoe, and while doing that, I noticed that everyone was taking their time looking at everything. And that was very different from where I came from and what I was used to. Back home, it was all \"do everything quickly, and leave as soon as possible.\" That was a huge surprise to me, but in a way, I was glad that I was able to experience something new.

My grandparents have a large feild behind their house so i would sit their and look at the wildlife. I remember at this time feeling alot of joy. I would go outside here to relax and do homework sometimes or maybe to de-stress. I would also sometimes run around the backyard and play with my dog. This made me feel very content. I also use to do the garden in my grandparents back yard with my grandfather. This make me feel a deeper connection with my grandfather and very loved.

I also tried to listen to the lyrics of the music that I was listening to. When I\'m in my room, I feel more happy because it is filled with things that I love, and it\'s usually where I go if I want to be alone or if I need to do homework. While thinking about school, I was feeling overwhelmed because I have a lot of work to do, and I have a lot to study for. On top of that, I have to work every weekend, so it is hard to devote all my time to school, because I feel like I need some time to relax too. I didn\'t really notice any aspects of my room more than any other times I look in my room...

It has awesome paths to walk along and benches to just sit and relax. Often I will walk there with my family, my mother and I will walk there alone or I will go there and walk with my boyfriend or friends. I just feel comfortable walking near the trees and the water it\'s so natural and nice to have something like that so close to home. It is relaxing to spend time near the river and I love it.     A lot of what I notice are the leaves especially now that it\'s fall and everything is changing. It\'s gorgeous to watch the leaves change and then fall. It\'s also great that it\'s still November and the weather is still moderately warm.

I also wish that I didn\'t have to work while in school, since working leaves less time for me to focus on my courses.  I hope that I am successful in university, so that I can have a career that I am happy with.    I noticed that many of the trees are bare now. I cannot believe how fast the time (and seasons) go by. It seems like time is going by faster and faster each day. It is not a scary feeling, though, because I am happy with what I am doing in life. I feel like I am on the right track. I just wish that there was a way to generate an income without interfering with my focus on school.

1148^CC^O^activity2^My bedroom is the place where I chose to relax. It was dark and quiet. I was lying on my bed comfortably on the comfy sheets with a large bedsheet over me. My pillow was soft and fluffy. I tried to black out my mind from all of the events that happened that day and just closed my eyes and relaxed. My mind felt heavy and I just wanted to be forgetful of all events. I fell asleep.

Hearing the water and the breeze in the trees brought a sense of calm over me and i was able to just reflect on the past few days and kind of re-centre myself. I felt as though everything in the world was calm and almost stopped. This also gave me energy and i felt like i was re energized and able to continue on in the day and life as a whole. I was able to reflect on some highly emotional situation which allowed me to reach some closure with these events.

1223^NR^O^activity2^i felt calm. Like there was no worries in the world, all the stress went away for a bit. Lately i have been thinking about transfering to be with my girlfriend in halifax, so i am usually kind of lonely and sad lately. however mroe happy because im doing alright in school so i should have the marks to transfer. being outside calmed me down and let me consider all the possiblities. i feel happy to be outside and away from my room and worries of school. i also talked to my mom in the park, about how things are going. being outside allowed me to talk freely and be myself, without the expectations or judgement of my fellow peers.  being outside makes me feel also a bit sad, becuase my girlfriend, whos in halifax, used to spend alot of time outside. it reminds me of all the good times so i miss them, but i guess being outside kind of brings me back in time to those memories. being outside i noticed nature and the animals. there was a chipmunk and a bird. they were flying and crawling around a nearby tree.

However, as I started to think about it more I was able to create a mental time table of how to accomplish what needed to be done and who I could contact if I needed further help.  I started to have less of stress feeling and I found I was more eager to continue with my work.

I immediately felt relaxed, though the sun coming into the room may have had some effect on that, too. I noticed some random things, like the colour of the couch (dark green), the fact that there were a few rips in the couch, how cold the floor was, etc. I was mostly stressing out over a law essay due Tuesday, so this little break helped me put things into perspective. I realized that it\'s not the end of the world if I don\'t understand it, as long as I do my best to try. So, I was quite calm by the time I left, and I felt ready to tackle the essay again from a different angle.

Thinking about how finals are going to be approaching sooner then ever and that time goes by so fast, that I couldn\'t believe it was already November.   I was watching Friends (the tv show),  and thinking about the future, what my life would be like in 10 years and if I\'ll be where I want to be. I remember feeling the same feeling I always get but never seem to act upn - I know what it is that I want to do but why am I so afraid to do it? I know that if I study harder, start working out, and just getting out more will be good, but I always find myself sitting on my couch.

I typically enjoy this time to look across the experimental farm and admire the geese, the land, and the sky. I am originally from a small town in northern ontario, and often I feel like i am back home when I bike through the farm. I also enjoy hearing the crows, as it represent tranquility, for me b/c at home when it is a beautiful day out I often hear  them. They are associated withy pleasant feelings.  It is nice to see the geese in the farm\'s field, b/c back home there is a field inwhich the geese always flock to come fall.   I also enjoy this time of yar b/c it is very beautiful. The leaves are almost off of the trees but there are still some leaves in the trees and on the ground. I love the smell of dry leaves so when I am biking I often inhale around one specific corner where there are often lots of leaves.   I sometmes think of simpler times when I admire nature.

I have a lot going on in my life, working full time and going to school ( will be taking MCAT\'s and applying to an M.D program within the next few semesters) so I don\'t have much time to reflect on much else at this point. I am just usually stressed out. I also like to think about my relationship with my boyfriend, because it can be a calming feeling. Or about plans I have with my friends...

It was a very nice day out and I was thinking that I had made a mistake when I put on my long sleeved shirt that day. I didn\'t sit on a bench or table, I choose a nice shady spot under a tree. As I sat there I was thinking about how much work I still had to so, but it was still nice to just take a break and semi-relax. While I was sitting there I looked around and enjoyed how beautiful the quad really is, in the middle of the campus centre, the quad is a very nice park like area. It was nice because the grass is very green and lush, the trees provided shade. Mid way through my time there, I lay down and cloud-watched, somethin I hadn\'t done in years. This brought memories from childhood of playing in my backyard. My backyard while I was young was big with many flower gardens surrounding it, and trees to create shade for us children. It bought memories of my siblings and I playing as my mom gardened.

My room is a mess, contributing to a cluttered mind.  I was thinking about how my messy room represents how unorganized my life is at the moment. By cleaning it I can start to make some organization in my life.   This made me begin to think about how well I am doing in school, and how much more time should be spent in this room doing homework.  As well as how I should be painting it from its dark colour to a more vibrant blue,  and how I should open my blinds so that every morning will be brighter. That way I can\'t sleep through my alarm at times or oversleep.

There is a desk in this room, where my mom used to sit and do work for her job. Often I sit at this desk also, to do school work and projects. At times the room makes me feel sad as I reminisce about past memories with my parents, but often it makes me feel closer with my mom. I have decorated in a way that relaxes me, with dim lights and such, which enables me to focus on school work. This is also a really place to lay down and rest, as it is a large, quiet room that helps me just get away from the rest of the world when I need. The blinds that cover the windows are dark, and block out most of the light. I have had troubles sleeping the last while, and sometimes this room helps me calm down and fall asleep quicker than usual. Overall, this room sometimes makes me miss the presence of my mom in my life, but at other times it enables me to feel closer with her and relax at times when I feel overwhelmed.

1243^NR^O^activity2^Recently i took a walk outside for an hour, it was late at night and the leaves were crunchy and it was really nice to walk along the streets kicking up the leaves. i was with a good friend and we had just come back from a movie. It was quiet outside and so the company was nice to have.

I thought about being a part of what was all around me, and I felt very calm and very small in comparison to everything, but also like I was part of this race that is everywhere and I wondered if someone else was thinking the same thing, because with over 6 billion people, it is hard to determine if any thought you ever have is original.

1187^NR^O^activity2^I spent time on my backyard which backs onto the Ottawa River. When I\'m outside I felt like I had a hard time relaxing. I would think about projects and homework I need to get done or small problems I\'ve been having with me friends. I don\'t feel like I had any really deep thoughts while relaxing mostly just thoughts and what\'s going on in my life with friends, family and school. I spent most of the time outside looking at the water flow by. One thing I noticed in particular was the change in flow direction as the weather changed from sunny to rainy.

1263^NR^O^activity2^On Friday evening at around 11:00pm, I was in a bad mood and wanted to get out of the house. I decided to take a walk around the neighborhood with my dog. It was moderately foggy outdoors, and very dark. It looks very mysterious at that time of night, and the stars and moon are somewhat visible above. I didn\'t encounter any other people and it was very relaxing and allowed me to get away from everything going on at my home. I went near the park, and the woods area nearby, but mostly stuck to the paths. I was also listening to my ipod. I can best describe my experience as feeling \"inspired\" although that sounds somewhat corny, but it allowed me to put some stressful aspects at home/school into perspective. I like how outdoors seems like a transformed place at night, and seem somewhat mysterious and curious. I think I get a bit of an adrenaline rush (particularly at night or if no one is around in an isolated area like the bike path) because of a slight possibility of danger or being outside of normal social areas. I love crosscountry running and so have a bit of an affinity for trails in the fall.

I tried to let my mind go blank. I felt the wind blowing on my face.

1197^NR^O^activity2^I went for a long walk on the canal with some friends the other night. It was about 12:00AM, it was chilly and windy. I know it sounds weird but I kind of like being out in the cold, I\'m talking like 6-1o degrees cold not -10. It lets myself unwind and think about everything that is going on in my life and things I need to do. I was wearing some sweat pants and a sweater with a jacket so I was nice and warm. My friends were talking to each other in the background and I was just doing my own thing. We walked swiftly, not fast but medium pace. We walked just up until a road called Seneca and turned around and went back to campus. I remember feeling kind of sad because I need to break it off with my boyfriend because we don\'t have time for each other any more because of school and what not and I feel that it has been a huge weight on my shoulders that needs to be taken off. So I pretty much thought about that the whole time and at random times I would think to myself about how I should have worn another sweater or a scarf. And at the back of my head I was hoping we wouldn\'t get raper and/or murdered because you always hear about those stories of how women go off in the middle of the night on the canal and get mugged or killed or whatever. But I was with a few of my friends so it didn\'t bother me as much as it would have...

I love the quite time at night right before I go to bed. I have time to think of the things I want, and my ideas are more clear and thoughtful this way. I enjoy the environment because it\'s the place where I feel most confortable in, and it\'s a place where I can really relax and rest.

1217^NR^O^activity2^In the past week, I went for a lovely walk in a beautiful park with a very special friend. The air was crisp and the gorgeous, colorful fall leaves were crumpling underneath my feet because they have fallen off the trees. The leaves all over the ground made me think of how winter and Christmas is fast approaching. As we walked through the park down by the edge of the canal, the sun was beating down, and I started to sweat a little. It was such amazing weather for the middle of November. It was a really nice walk and it was especially nice to be able to chat with my friend. I missed him a lot. He recently had to start chemo because he was diagnosed with cancer. I have been battling cancer for the past 3 years. I can\'t believe that someone as healthy as my friend was able to get cancer too! It is crazy how many people are actually diagnosed with cancer everyday! I wonder if there will ever be a cure. Having to go through what I have gone through makes me appreciate my life more and all the little things that most of us take for granted. That day in the park was perfect, and for once it felt like I had no problems or a care in the world! A relaxing, peaceful day that let me escape for a little while.

I have looked through a lot of his stuff on his computer and found some things I didn\'t want to read or see. He has pictures of him and his ex, like what the fuck. Why do you still need those? A dirty conversation also with another girl. Does he not care about me at all? Are we just a huge lie. I am so confused and hurt, all I want to do is curl up and cry. I have no idea when is getting home because God forbid he even calls me. Anyways there is laundry everywhere and a weird chair. A lot of sparay paint cans and empty boxes. I just watched a show with his sister, she is my age. Extremely nice and we get along so well. I am really glad about that. I am so uncomfortable in this house alone. It\'s freezing and smells like when laundry down here. The kitten is sleeping next to me and purring very loud, it\'s so adorable. I still wish he would call me. It\'s almost four in the morning. What can he possibly be doing? I have the feeling he is seeing other girls. I have no idea what to think or do. I am sick of being cold, it\'s driving me crazy.

1279^NR^O^activity2^Late afternoon visit to the Arboretum with my two young boys. It was cool, but bright. A Fall breeze whispering through the trees. Leaves rustling above and on the ground. Kids squealing, laughing, running, playing. They are alive outside, in nature. Gives me a renewed sense of energy and life. Deep, full breaths of air. Walking, enjoying the movement and the flow of blood through my limbs and body. Lots to see and take in... colours, smells, sounds. Dogs running and playing, makes me smile. Geese and ducks taking flight from the pond... it\'s getting cold, winter is coming, I feel angry and upset, my bones shiver. Excited calls from the kids. Perk up again to investigate what they have discovered and want to share. The cold thoughts of winter linger, but slowly melt as I reintegrate with my current surroundings. Look at the gorgeous leaves, smell the wet earth. So rich. I catch sight of the squirrels. Bushy tails, soft and cute, but busy, busy, busy... stupid winter. Time to quicken our pace and get around the loop. It\'s getting dark, too early. So much life and enthusiasm here, experienced individually and shared, but winter is just around the corner... Life will cease to exist in this capacity. I appreciate the seasons, even winter can be beautiful, but this time of year brings much anxiety and stress. I want the sun. I want brightness and warmth, colour and life. Gather our collections (leaves and twigs) and head back to the car. The fresh air has does wonders... we\'re all pink-cheeked and feeling refreshed. A good little escape.

1262^CC^O^activity2^The room is my bedroom, and I most often come here to use the computer, do homework and sleep. I am situated beside a fairly large window overloooking my street, and when I have been searching for the right words for an essay, or even a facebook post, I will sit and look outside at the front lawns outside and think. My room is a space of my own, I decided almost all of the elements that are a part of it, I chose the pictures and locations of everything and this is the space where I feel most like myself. I can come here and feel like I won\'t be judged by anyone, that I can take as much time for myself and reflect,dance to my music,keep in touch with an old friend, and sleep. I chose to paint my room a bright orange when I was about 12 or so, and to this day I still love it. It is a tone that balances so perfectly on the fine line of calm and energy. It is great for when I am needing to focus myself on a task,or relax, and great for those sunny days where I am feeling great and energized. I love my room, I sincerely don\'t think I would change a thing about it. I have some of my favorite works of art surronding my desk, mirror and bed. I also have a collage of me and some friends and family parrallel to my desk. This is important to me so I can always know how lucky and priviledged I am to have such amazing people in my life. I also have a poster of an ariel shot of Paris, where I went in grade 11, and had such an incredible time. I feel so lucky to have been able to go there and reminds me that I will someday get the opportunity to go back.   My room is my space. Noone else\'s, it has elements that only I can relate to and understand, and that is so important to me.

In the past few days I have been feeling very homesick, and as a result of this I\'m going to be visiting home next weekend. However, that being said, I feel a sense of home when I\'m in my bedroom, it\'s comfortable and cozy which is what makes it the perfect place to sit with my thoughts when I\'m wanting to be alone.  The emotions I was feeling were greatly due to stress, overwhelming thoughts of the amount of assignments are due in the next few weeks and also my feelings of wanting to go home.  Whenever I\'m feeling a great amount of stress I always feel better about everything when I take some time and go home to relax.

Here I think alot about everything that is going on in my life and what I want to change about it. I think what I need to do to be happy. I think about my friends and homework that still needs to be done. My room is colorfull because of my roomate\'s side. Her wall is covered with pictures unlike mine wich has one poster that i bought at wallmart a little while ago. The deepest feeling that I feel when I am in here I guess I feel really anywhere, I just get to freely think about them in this room. I recently broke up with a boyfriend that I have dated for almost 2 years because I felt that the spark in our relationship was dying and that I thought that I deserved more from him. It was in this room that I decided how to go on about everything even though I think I would have decided this almost anywhere since I still had a change in me. In this room I also think about what I want to do for the rest of my life career wise and what will make me happy, because I don\'t feel happy right now, I feel low and spiritless for a lot of my time and I don\'t think that is how a 18 year old girl is sopposed to feel. I should be alive and fun like i used to be.

1275^NR^O^activity2^Walking downtown Ottawa in my favorite black pea-coat and purple scarf just enjoying a walk. I had nowhere to go besides back to res, but I just needed some time to reflect. The city just feels like home. The hustle and bustle of buses and cars and cabbies. Its just so romantic. Even as the exhaust from a bus clouds my vision, it doesnt keep me from enjoying every second of my pointless walk. I consider walking to my boyfriend\'s aunt\'s house and visiting with her. but instead I just walk downtown and invision a lif where this is what I do every single minute of my life. And then it hits me liek a big yellow school bus. This is my life. It isn\'t Louke\'s life. I live everyday trying to please and impress him when in reality the road he is taking, the one that I thought that I would love to take along with his isn\'t really what I want at all. I want my own life. I have never been the girl that tags along- I always take my own path. I like being alone-its refreshing. I don\'t want to live a life where I am constantly at the hands of a dictator who is my \"meal ticket\". I got here because I worked my butt off throughout my entire life. I did all the extra credit while maintaining a vital social life. I lived a well rounded life that I deserve to life. I deserve to follow my own dreams. In 4 years, at the end, he wants to be in the NHL or in Europe playing the game that got him drafted and sent to one of the most prestigious schools in the US. I want to be enrolling in my masters. I want to do great things. I don\'t want to be his little hockey wifey. I just love him so much that I don\'t want to give him up. I also would die to see him with anyone else. I want to live in a big city where I have the freedom of choice to do what I want. Not being a prisoner in a relationship.

1292^CC^O^activity2^for this excersise i chose my bedroom. when in my bedroom i felt safe, sleepy and pretty much at ease. Lately I\'ve been really moody, and so I\'ve been feeling pretty isolated. When this happens I like to crawl into bed, grad a pint of ice cream and read a good book or watch grey\'s anatomy. When this type of \'black\' mood hits, i tend to associate repreive with my bedroom; specifically my bed. Its cozy and soft and inviting and makes me feel completely isolated from whatever it is thats bothering me at that point in time.     however, i also find it difficult to get out of bed under the black mood. Whenever I need to be productive i never EVER go into my bedroom becuase I always fall asleep or become engrossed in a book or surfing the net. Not a good idea.

1256^CC^O^activity2^I came home from university this weekend because I knew that I would get much more studying for midterms done.  The place I choose to study was my bedroom because it is the most comfortable place.  My room makes my feel worry free and relaxed.  Sometimes I wish I hadn\'t have taken so much stuff to school with me because it is kind of dull.  I sometimes wonder how my mom feels when she goes into my room; if it makes her sad that I took so much of my stuff away with me.

1172^CC^O^activity2^When I got dan\'s house i was relieved and tired. And happy. We went to his room where he was playing techno and we cuddled and he gave me an envelope. in the envelope there were many laminated leaves. i love leaves and he knows this. so he had laminated some for me. because autumn is almost over and there won\'t be anymore. I was SOOO happy. We kissed and cuddled and we were glad. And cute. I like him a lot and I was really touched by this gift because its such a perfect gift for me. There was something else in the envelope he had gotten us a marriage liscence form thing. That was really cute and awesome too. We stayed in his room for a long time cuddling. I noticed that his room doesn\'t have normal lights he has a green light and a blue light which makes the lighting in the room very strange. Green and Blue are kind of themes in his room. He has medical paraphanalia. His room is messy. He has an x-box and an old clock and a fountain. He has video games. He has an air gun thing. He still has a tab of ..something.... stuck to his wall from last time. ...... We left. When we returned we were drunk and drinking beer. but we were really happy and it was great. I was so happy. His bed is rather comfortable and we cuddled. When I\'m with Dan in his room I am content, calm and safe. I don\'t have to think about all the stress in my life, in regards to school, work and my family. He lives in carleton place and thats seperate and rather far away from all those troubles. It was nice. It\'s like that most of the time. Except when Dan got into a mood. I was anxious, worried, sad , self concsious and scared when he wouldn\'t cuddle with me and stopped talking to me. He gets into moods sometimes. He mumbled something about there being a bed in the basement so I began to cry. I was hurt. Then he comforted me,. Dan has some problems. Including not thinking he is worth a lot. And he thought that maybe i didn\'t want to be there. He is kind of illogical. But thats cuz he has problems. I was confused really confused. We fell asleep. We woke up happy and content and sleepy. We cuddled for hours and hours. We talked about what happened  and resolved a few things and came to a better understanding of us. We played videogames and cuddled. My deepest thoughts at the time were during the crisis thing was that Dan\'s depression and mental state is a lot more troubled than I had thought and affects a lot more aspects of his life than I had thought. I resolved to be good to him, to be good for him. I resolve that I am going to help him through some of his troubles. I like him a lot. My deepest feelings while I was in that room were at different periods, content and peace. and then during the crisis hurt. I was really hurt. And then vague understanding that he is far more complicated than I had previously imagined and that his issues can not just be explained in a sentence.  I\'m sorry for the jumble of confusing it is difficult to put everything I felt while in that room into words. Overall though, I was peaceful and happy.

I didn\'t take nature for granteded at that moment. It really was peaceful and relaxing to just be outside.

1219^NR^O^activity2^On Thursday, I went to river by Carleton and ate lunch there with a friend. It was a beautiful day and I was wondering where the time went. I was looking t the trees and most of them have lost their leaves then I was thinking of how just  a week ago it has snow. It frightened me to think of what is going on with our planet and global warming. The sun felt so warm on my skin, I layed down on the grass and felt so peaceful. I looked over to the path on the other side of the river and noticed people were walking there and some stopped to look at the river and I was wondering what they were thinking about. Then I wondered where the path leads to and decided that one day ill go and find out. When I was looking at the river I noticed that the water wasn\'t clear and I started thinking that this is the same water that’s at Mooney’s Bay and how I bathed in it before, which kind of grossed me out. I looked down the river and noticed that there weren’t any ducks today and I wondered where they were because usually they’re there. I looked up at the train passing by and I was wondering where the people were going.  Overall I felt very calm and at ease.

1242^CC^O^activity2^I was in my room, which was extremely dirty. My laundry is definitely overflowing; everytime i look at it i feel really guilty, like i should take a few hours today to do all my laundry. I also was thinking that that was not going to happen firstly because I\'m really lazy when it comes to laundry and secondly, because i\'m worrying about my psych assignment due tomorrow. I didn\'t think i had time today. My bed is surprisingly neat, it looked as if it was made. Lately I\'ve moved around alot in my sleep and my sheets and bedspread have been falling off my bed, which is really wierd because i feel like I would have woken up if I was tossing and turning. I was sitting at my computer, as always when i was bored. My desk is a complete mess and I was thinking that i really should clean it, because i get so stressed when I don\'t have alot of space. Its really crazy how I let things get so messy. It\'s a problem I\'ve had all throughout my life. I was on facebook on my computer and I was looking through my friend\'s pictures from london. I really miss home and all my friends back in london; it gets me really sad sometimes. But I remember thinking that i love ottawa. All the time on facebook I wish that people will write on my wall because I love when people do. It makes me feel special, almost popular. And I love feeling liked. I was thinking about how lucky I am here at Carleton. My whole floor is filled with amazing people and I like almost everyone! While i was sitting at my computer, I was listening to my iPod on my stereo. I remember the song \'It\'s All Over\' from the Dreamgirls soundtrack came on. I absolutely love that song and I get chills everytime I hear it, and I most definitely got them today. I really love that feeling, when you like a song so much that it gives you intense chills. I love it so much and so many songs do it to me. Then my friend called! She is my best friend in the whole world. It\'s horrible because I picture my friend jesse as my best friend in the world. But if you sum up everything thats happened between me and jesse and me and bev, I think that Bev has been the better friend, the best friend, in that she calls all the time and tries to stay connected even though she\'s in london. And i love her so much for that, i can\'t ask for a better friend. We talked for almost 2 hours, which is sort of bad because i was planning on spending the whole day in the library doing my history and psych assignments. But I love talking to her and when I saw her name pop up on my phone telling me she was calling, I got really excited. We were talking about everything, just catching up. She said \'tell me all about your week and weekend, you first\' and i did. I told her about how this week has been amazing; how i got back alot of good marks and how i\'m so happy with my life right now. I also told her about the party i went to on friday night at Ottawa U and how i found out that this girl really likes me and i actually like her too and how I am really excited about it. But it\'s horrible becuase every single time i talk about another girl that i like to bev, the thought of me not being over Bev still hits me in the back of my head. I keep telling myself, and everyone that I\'m so over Bev, but realisticaly, Im not at all. Sure I\'d like to have a relationship with her, more than friends, but I dont know. I love her as a best friend and I\'m pretty sure it\'ll be like that for the rest of our lives. Anyways, she then told me about her week and how she ha d the staples taken out of her head by her Aunt Julie. She also told me about her troubles with Lee, and how Lee is really jealous of Bev\'s relationship with her friend Kara. Lee and Kara were best friends (and i think theyre still) but Bev sees more of Kara than Lee and therefore they\'ve become really close. Lee doesn\'t like that and apparently she\'s being really rude and inconsiderate and ignorant towards them. And then Bev was telling me about Jo and Ty, and their stupid relationship. Everytime i hear things about their relationship I want to slap each of them in the face. seriously, they fight about the stupidest things in the world and they only pay attention to eachother, they do everything together. It\'s really annoying to Bev because Jo\'s her best friend and she doesnt see enough of her because Jo and Ty are always together. It\'s really annoying to even me, even when im in a di

It is quiet, I can think and I have realized many things working in the library all day that will affect the rest of my life, such as a change in my degree. I notice other people working and it makes me want to do work as well. My deepest feelings are that I wish i had someone who I could be with as in a boyfriend, who likes me for myself and does not just want one thing. I miss relaxing with my old boyfriend in the library back home because those were some of the best times of my life.

I was by myself and I basically just contemplated about what I need to do, in the present and in the future... I thought about my homework that was due and the fact that exams were coming up... Most importantly I thought about how I would be back home in Toronto and how I would get to see my freinds and family...    This thought made me anxious to see them, I remembered how much I missed them..    I guess you could say that this experience allowed me to focus on what was most important in my life...My family, freinds and education....

I walk into a booth that is all my own without the distraction of seeing others around me. There is a low murmur of others around the cafe but no words can really be made out from their conversations. I feel like I can think whatever I want and reflect upon the day as I peacefully read and write for class homework. There\'s nice background music basking in the room and everyone seems to share that feeling of ease and clear-mindedness. The outdoors gets less and less illuminated while The Page Break stays warmly lit. I feel productive. Homework gets done and then I walk back to residence feeling accomplished and ready to socialize without the burden of work upon my shoulders.

It was my chance to let go of the guilt for not doing work but instead to turn the heat up to a comfortable temperature and sit comfy under a blanket. I could feel the tension in my body but i tried to let it go and just relax. I allowed the sad story of the tv show to move me. I felt sad because i think i had been trying to hold myself together for days and this is when i chose to just relax and feel what was going on inside me.   it was a safe feeling because all the belongings surrounding me were familiar. The couch was safe and comfortable.

I tend to take the trails through the woods more so than the main trails because I like to be in a more wild area. The woods tend to be quiet, on occasion there are some kids biking around but for the most part there is nobody. My mind is usually blank, I whistle or sing to myself sometimes, I look at the tree\'s, the leaves and the earth. I often play with the dog so that she gets some exercise. I\'m usually up in the park 3-4 times a week.

1298^CC^O^activity2^I enjoy spending a lot of of time in my room, i like to be able to write my essays in there, speak with friends on the phone, etc.  I also o a lot of reading in there.  As a Christian I spend a lot of time reading my Bible in my room which brings me much hope, happiness, security and questions as well.  I like to just reflect, talk to God, think up solutions to my questions and feel a strong sense of connection to God, my higher power.  my room is a relatively relaxing place, doe snot have a lot of really bright neon-ish colours but it does have greens, pinks, blues, etc. and  just find it relaxing and calming. Usually this connection with God and time spent in my room occurs at night bfore bed hen I get a really nice chance to relax and reflect.... sort of an escape from the hustle and bustle of my children, work, my school work, and any othr stressful problems.  while i don\'t get stressed that easily, i think that is a reflexion of the fact that i always have this time with Bible, at least ten minutes usually about 20 where i just feel loved, connected, hopefuly, etc. because of God and being relaxed in my room.

I work as a waitress at a restaurant so to just get that peace and quiet for me was so relaxing. I\'ve been stressed out about school work and my job lately and how I\'ve been doing too much and not enough for me. I thought about how I need to make some more time just for me to do things like this. I would be less stressed out and happier if I could manage my time better and just get an hour for me each day. I think I\'m sad lately and distancing myself because I am working so hard. I think I need to arrange some time to go out with my friends for a night. I hope I am able to reach this goal.

1254^CC^O^activity2^I was lying on the couch yesterday with a blanket trying to sleep but not really getting there. The major emotions I was feeling were complete loneliness and a very deep longing to be with my fiance who I have not seen in 3 months. This brought about feelings of just wanting to pull the blankets over my head and disappearing. I also kept thinking about the amount of work I still have to do and exams and assignments etc. that are due soon. In doing this I did not really notice the world around me as I was only aware of what was going on in my head, which happens for me a lot. I do remember thinking that the couch and the blanket were really comfortable and wondering why I could not just go into a deep sleep where nothing really matters.

1312^CC^O^activity2^I decided i would spend some time in my favourite coffee shop on laurier street called Starbucks. When i was there i thought everything was very inviting and i felt calm as well as collected. I noticed a few paintings on the wall that were very artistic and colourful which made my reading much more enjoyable. My deepest feelings began with anxiety deep down because i had alot of homework readings to catch up with, but as i got my favourite blended drink, i felt very independent and mature. I really enjoyed sitting by myself and listening to the jazz music that they had going. As the time went by i felt i could stay in there for hours on end and i began to feel more at ease and relaxed as i read. The people and the environment was very welcoming which at the time made me feel happy which has now made me feel like i want to go there tonight.

1286^CC^O^activity2^i recently spent the majority of my time the last 3 days participating in a real estate seminare, where a gentleman by the name of Marc dicussed how i could change my future by taking the next step. At first i wasnt to sure about what the seminar was going to bring, but being there hearing him talk made me feel very motivated to change my life and move forward. I learned to look past the i cant and in sted say how can i. i feel this is something thats very little but will help be a great deal with looking within myself to go further. i felt encouraged and fearful at the same time. fearful cuz if i do do this i dont want to fail, but u\'ll never know until u do try it.

1244^CC^O^activity2^While in my indoor place, I felt very content for the most part.  I am fairly happy with my life as it is right now, and do not have a whole lot of reasons to be unhappy.  I did, however, think about things that I\'m anxious about such as keeping my scholarship for school, being able to pay for next semester\'s tuition both with and without the scholarship.  I\'m worried about how my tuition next semester will affect my parents.  They paid for the first semester for me, and I am very grateful for that.  They don\'t have a lot of money though, and with my two brothers and me, it\'s a lot to afford.  They keep talking about how they know I\'m going to be able to maintain my scholarship for next semester, however I feel strongly that I will not and I am afraid of disappointing my parents.  I considered how much time I spend procrastinating, and how it\'s a big problem.  I feel as though I can\'t help but avoid doing the work that I have which stresses me out.  I do my work, and it\'s always on time, but I\'m sure that the quality could be better.  I also worry about how the transition from high school to university affects me.  I realize that it takes a whole lot more responsibility initiative to do the work, but I find that I struggle to keep track of the work and find that sometimes it creeps up on me.  I considered how much time I spend at home, yet do so little on my coursework and helping out around the house.  My parents have started to demand a lot more from me, stating that I\'m in university now and thus there is more responsbility with that, and expect me to do a lot more around the house.  I regularly end up getting scolded for forgetting to do a load of laundry, or not getting a chance to do the dishes.  And I know it sounds like my parents are super strict, but it\'s not like that.  They have their own things to worry about.  My mom has a lot of responsibility at her job that\'s not actually in the job description, plus she\'s taking courses to get a human resources certification.  She also somehow finds time to manage my brother\'s hockey team, and take on fundraisers as well.  She has a lot to worry about, and has a knack for making me feel guilty when I don\'t go the extra mile at home.  But she\'s not as bad as I make her sound.  She\'s great.  We get along really almost all of the time, and she is easy to talk to.  It\'s just that sometimes it makes me frustrated to have to listen to her tell me that I\'m irresponsible and that I am a selfish person who never thinks about anyone else.  While in my indoor place, I thought about how messy it is.  I am relatively organized, however my room is the one exception.  I cannot organize it no matter how hard I try.  It is in a constant state of dissarray, yet it\'s the only way I can live in it.  I don\'t really understand how I can organize everything else, with the exception of my room, but that\'s the way it is.  I noticed that, as usual, there was clothes everywhere, small change on the top of my dresser, books scattered across the floor, and my bed sitting, unmade.  Besides that, for the most part, I just tried to empty my mind of all thoughts, and to relax.  Unfortunately, my nagging memory of things that I should have been doing left me unable to relax.

1295^NR^O^activity2^I live walking distance to the mississippi river. I enjoy the walk that I take getting there. I have done this walk off and on for 6 years. I notice that at certain homes I expect to see certain things.  A dog that is always in the back yard. A cat that is always in the window. I try to stay focused on the momment but find my mind wandering most of the time. Usually on something that is going on in my life that I\'m trying to work out. I find this walk is almost in a way of purging what is causing me pain. My latest thoughts have been focused on my father and his new marriage. He married the woman that he cheated on my mother with. At the wedding my sister and I felt like out casts and were left out of the wedding.  We even sat at the back of the room up on the balcony during the wedding and recpetion. I found it so difficult to talk to the guest. It was suppose to be a happy occasion but both my sister and I were in so much pain. People were constantly asking us questions that assumed we had happy answers to. So like a good girl I said all the right things. But, by the river in a place that is suppose to bring peace and love I replay those conversations with the responses I really wanted to give. Its half torturing myself and half an attempt to make myself feel better. I\'ve adopted a new motto \"it is what it is\". However it only works on the small things.

I thought about my current struggles with addictions and relationships. I wrote a lot in my journal and then took time to rest and cry. I kept the lighting low and made sure I had lots of blankets and pillows. I felt renewed and content.

We were just lying there and i remember feeling really calm but at the same time really sad. I knew that I would be leaving soon (i was home for the weekend visiting) and everytime I leave its very hard for me. Just thinking about it makes me sad. He lay a blanket out on the carpeted floor of the room, it was a toronto maple leafs blanket, and he got another one to use as a pillow. Easterm promises was playing on the tv. He fell asleep while we waited for a phone call from his sister. I wished i could stay in that moment forever. laying in his arms so relaxed. I miss him. The sadness of being away from him is coming back.... the tears..

1327^NR^O^activity2^I chose to spend time outside on the deck. It is a small deck, attached to my small apartment. I live in a nice neighbourhood though so sitting on the deck is very relaxing, watching neighbours pass by and people going on with their lives. It is a very omniscient feeling. While I am on the deck, more often than not I am smoking, which is interesting because I don\'t actually smoke. All I can do while I am on the deck is think, I\'m not talking to anybody, I\'m not reading, it is me and my thoughts alone. The majority of my thoughts are monopolized by two things; my mother, and my \"I don\'t want a relationship\" guy-friend Steven. Regarding my mother, she died of cancer when I was 16, so mostly I think of how much I miss her, how my life would be different if she were here and whether or not she would be proud of everything I have done, or disappointed at everything I haven\'t done. Regarding Steven, I think of how strange it is for me to yearn for someone so much when they are physically not as impressive as previous guys I have dated. Though we\'re not dating because he doesn\'t want a relationship, but we really like each other, we\'re now sleeping together and we talk to each other all the time. So the only thing that we are missing to make this a relationship is his admission that it basically already is. In as much detail as I can muster in 10 mins. thats usually what I think about on my deck. Sometimes school work will pop in, but I don\'t care enough about it to let it take up too much of my deep thinking time.

1121^NR^O^activity2^We went for a walk together in our neighbourhood. It was a peaceful walk on Sunday morning. The traffic was pretty much nonexistent, there weren\'t very many people out, just a couple of people walking their dogs. It was cool out--we had gone for a walk shortly after getting out of bed. I didn\'t even take the time to shower, I just wanted to get outside.    I really enjoyed the act of walking itself. It felt sort of different from the other walks we had taken. I had finally dropped my class and the stress of trying to balance being a student and working full time and managing our house is now gone. Now I felt like I could focus my efforts. I actually felt a bit better physically then I had in awhile.     While walking, I spent some time noticing the leaves on the ground. I really like leaves. I also noticed the landcaping on various properties. I really like the look of manicured gardens and ornamental trees. I like being outside in that space--it is now familiar and safe. It\'s still suburban and close to home but it feels quiet. There are some various trials just off the mainroad that I always think I\'d like to take but I get scared. They\'re near bushy areas and I don\'t like the thought of walking where it is secluded.     Even though I was fairly relaxed, I found myself feeling guilty. Guilty for dropping my course. Guilty for letting myself done. Guilty for missing it already. I also felt worried about my husband\'s health. There is something going on that he won\'t look into. I\'ve been thinking about it all weekend and it has been stressing me out.     While I was trying to enjoy being outside in the fresh air, I had a lot of things on my mind that didn\'t allow me to fully experience being outdoors. I remember remarking that the sun was coming out just as we turned down our street. I wish it would have been out the whole time.    One thing that I did like is that on our way home we stopped by a local cafe and bought some baked goods. We went inside and had breakfast and I spent a good portion of the time gazing outside.

1224^CC^O^activity2^The indoor place that I chose to spend time in recently would be my own room, I especially like spending time in my room when it is cold outside. My room is always warm and I love relaxing in it during winter. When I\'m in my room I usually read or do some work. During these times the feeling that I feel the most is content, followed by happiness and a positive outlook of the future. When I read I usually do it in bed which adds to the factor of contentment, furthermore I feel safe and comfortable. If I don\'t have a book to read or any work, I\'d usually lie down and think about various inventions that would be useful to mankind or how to make money in today\'s economy. I find that in that specific environment that I am able to think clearly and efficiently, and I usually end up with alot of ideas and theories.

1250^CC^O^activity2^i felt peaceful in the place where i could relax.  It was in my bedroom, where I could just relax and watch a movie, unwinding my thoughts from the day.  I was able to think about my decisions for the day and managed to plan my next day accordingly.  The things that I would have to accomplish, just as homework and school.  I would have to invest much of my time studying for upcoming midterms as well as essays.  this did begin to stress me out.  i was thinking about all the work that i had to complete, and by avoiding this work, by relaxing in my room lead to my rather unproductive self.  This causes me to feel as though I won\'t ever achieve my goals, and I will never be able to finish my work.  causing me to worry, be upset that I lack discipline.  Overall my peaceful place does begin this way, but it ends with me becoming more stressed out.

1326^CC^O^activity2^I spent my time in my bedroom. I lit some candles and turned on some soft music - worship music by my favourite Christian artist. I decided to try \"soaking prayer\" which my parents have described to me, which they do regularly. It is kind of like meditation. I said a quick prayer for relaxation and comfort, since I have had a very rough few weeks with deaths and other stress in my life. I only soaked for about five minutes, I found it very challenging to quiet my mind. So I sat up and actually began reflecting on a conversation that I had with my spiritual advisor a few weeks ago. As I took the time to think about it, some of the things he said really sunk in - things about my obsessive nature, why do I feel like things have to be perfect? I realized it\'s all about control - I find during stressful times I get more obsessive and that\'s my coping mechanism. I like things to be in order, and I get very overwhelmed when I don\'t have control over situations. One thing in particular is that my boyfriend and I have seriously discussed getting married next fall - we made the decision together. I wanted a year to be engaged, so I can make all the plans. Well now it\'s November, and that means I won\'t have a full year to plan. Planning for the future is what I spend most of my time on, probably to much, but I am a planner. It\'s stressful for me because an engagement is something I have no control over, but it\'s something I want so badly. So I\'ve decided to work on letting go of that... because I found myself getting so frustrated with him over the littlest things, and it just isn\'t worth it... so I need to just breathe and trust that it will happen!! Now I\'ve been reminding myself of that... that I have to trust in him and in Jesus that what is supposed to happen, will, and I just have to keep doing the best I can, which I am doing. I feel more at peace with my life situation now, even though the circumstances haven\'t changed.

I was having fun and was with people I love.  I noticed the waves crashing against the rocks below us, I noticed all the squirrels running and the trees blowing in the wind, I noticed the dogs kicking up the multicolored leves lying everywhere, damp and chilly.  I noticed the mud from the rain the night before, and how it was cooler because we were by the water.

I watch closely in silence as people walk by, observe nature, walk dogs, and have a conversation with a friend or loved one. I fall in and out of a daze as a I watch closely at what the movements are outside of both nature and people. A voice in the faint background asks me what I want for dinner, or if i\'m even hungry yet. My mother then comes in asking me if all of my homework is completed. I reply with a yes, even though it isn\'t, just so I can have minutes more laying on this body-sinking couch. Blankets are not near so I use pillows to keep me warm as the sun starts to go down, not shining in the window anymore. I finally fall asleep after watching the yellow-sided house across the street ever so closely. Before I know it, it is time to wake up for dinner to my dad playing the 6:00 news on a sunday evening. My parents both laugh at me and say I should be getting more sleep on the weekends, but i don\'t care, it is just a day of rest for me. I finally get up at about 6:15 in time to eat my mother\'s sunday evening dinner, only to know that i have a ton of schoolwork to do afterwords. At least I got my relaxing afternoon of sun and observing in.

1301^NR^O^activity2^Today I went to a nearby park with a 15 month old child that i care for part-time on weekdays. It was somewhat cold outside and there were fall leaves everywhere, which made the scenary prettier than usual. I remember envisioning my wedding day (which will be in next october) and hoping that there will be just as many leaves then as there is now. I played with the child on the ground, on the swing, and held her hands to help her walk, as she cannot walk yet on her own. I remember thinking that I hope I get to see her first steps on her own before my job is finished (the family I work for is moving to Vancouver in December). She is such a sweet little girl and I was very content to be spending time outdoors with her. There were men in the park using one of those things that blows leaves and I remember thinking about how weird that was. I am not from the city - I grew up on a gravel road surrounded by multiple farms, and where I am from, we don\'t alter nature by things like blowing leaves, we jut let them fall where they fall. Or if we feel like moving them, we rake them into a pile but we don\'t throw them out. We allow nature to decompose them. So I thought it was weird that these men were blowing the leaves off the pathways in the park. Especially since it\'s windy outside today...What\'s the point? Besides, the gas used to generate those machines is probably destroying the environment as well. Who would pay a person to do such a meaningless job? They are at this same park doing the same thing everyday...But other than that, I had a great time at the park and once the wind started to pick up more, I sat the child in her stroller and took her home where it was warm, to have some lunch.

1325^NR^O^activity2^I chose to sit on the balcony of my apartment.  It was fairly cool, and I should have worn a sweater.  But I didn\'t.  The children of the family in the apartment above us were playing below, and it made me feel kind of sad.  I\'m getting pretty homesick this year, especially in regards to missing my little brother.  I felt pretty upset the more I thought about it.  So I stopped thinking about home, and started planning my weekend.  I wanted to visit friends on Saturday night, which I knew would cheer me up a little.  I also had a whole lot of readings and assignments to finish, which kind of stressed me out.  A squirrel an up the tree on the front lawn of the building, which again reminded me of home and living the country, as opposed to this suburban living.  I managed to generate a topic to write one of my papers on, the concept of academic acceleration, a topic with genuinely frustrates me.  I feel slightly alienated being in second year and the only one of my friends who is not yet 19.  Spending nights in while everyone else goes out is lonely, and I won\'t be 19 until the beginning of exams in the spring.  I feel slightly desperate and out of control right now, with all the little problems I\'m experiencing outweighing the good ones.  Being outside and watching the kids enjoy playing, and other people casually walking by does not help that at all.

1241^NR^O^activity2^I notice the sun on my face and the wind in the trees. How green the grass is compared to the brown of the bare trees. The empty branches are like cracks in the sky. Being outside in the fresh air and open space gives a feeling of freedom. The weather is getting colder, so the air is sometimes biting, in contrast to the sun. The birds are all gone, so it\'s quiet except for the distant sounds of cars on the road, and perhaps the sound of children playing in the nearby park. Some leaves haven\'t been swept up and they crunch underfoot.

1341^NR^O^activity2^Got out from the gym and waited at the bus stop, feeling calm and tired in a good way from the workout. Standing at the bus stop, noticed all the other people standing and waiting as well. Noticed the weather was getting colder, the skies a little darker. Thought about what I had to do to do better in school, improve my marks especially in psychology. Thought about what I wanted to eat when I got home and how i would spend the rest of the night. Thought about my friends back home and what they might be doing or thinking, as well as my family. Worried if I would have enough money to last me the rest of the semester, figured it was probably time to get a job.

1291^NR^O^activity2^I went for a hike in the Gatineau Hills recently while the leaves were still changing color.  (approx 2 weeks ago).  We hiked up a long trial that led us to a spectacular view of the Ottawa Valley. The view itself was filled with colour everywhere we looked. Vibrant reds, yellows, oranges and greens filled our view!  The valley itself was like a patch work quilt and we were able to look over across the valley and spy the parliament buildings in the distance.  I felt peace, calm and a sense of awe that nature really is so beautiful in the fall months.  The effort of the hike itself left me feeling great!  I am a very athletic person, so both the views, colors and the activity left me feeling like I was in tune with myself and nature all at once!!

1277^NR^O^activity2^I took a walk on Saturday morning. I had been out the night before, had gotten into a fight with my friend and needed to clear my head. I only walked for about half an hour around my block but the fresh air and the sun was exactly what I needed. I noticed other people walking and jogging by, either alone or with pets, friends. I thought about how much I needed this time for myself. Tme to relax, time to think, and time to be alone. The cool wind was probably the thing I took the most note of. It wasn\'t so cold that I needed a jacket, and instead of the wind feeling unpleasant and harsh against my face, it seemed to revive me and wake me up. I noticed that the more I thought about the argument I had, the fast I kept walking, almost as if i was determined to walk the anger out of me.   Since it was early in the morning, there were people out, but no so many people that it distracted me. I was walking through a park, away from the cars and traffic, horns and people yelling, which helped to calm me down and let me be at peace and quiet in my own head.   The more I think about it, the more I would love to be able to have the motivation and the time to go for at least a half an hour walk everyday. Not only would it provide me with exercise but it would provide me with quiet time just to think. The problem is, I don\'t usually have the time, or the weather isn\'t right, and I rarely have the motivation. There\'s always an excuse!

1273^NR^O^activity2^I chose to go to a very wide open park with lots of trees, and a baseball diamond, with swings and a slide for the kids, and it also had a tennis court.  I noticed all the leaves have finally come off the trees and are all crunchy when you walk on them.  The air was bitter and dry and made it hard to be out there for longer then a half hour.  I thought about my boyfriend, and the fact at how scared I am that he is going to leave me.  I have no reason to believe he is going to because he has never given me that impression, but I just think that he deserves someone prettier and that one day he is going to realize that.  I cry almost 3 or 4 times a week just thinking about that I would do if he left me.  I also thought about how much debt I am in especially with christmas coming up.  I have my visa maxed out and dont have a job because of school.  I just feel very unhappy these day and wish I didnt have any problems.

1319^NR^O^activity2^I was happy to be in nature. I enjoyed just feeling everything around me, the sun, the wind, the air. I could hear the birds and the small animals. It was very tranquile. I just thought about my life, what I\'d like to do in my life, and my family and how much they mean to me. I thought about songs that I enjoy and songs I listen to that move me. I thought about my favourite songs that relax me and move me and touch me. I felt more relaxed than I thought I would, even though I wasn\'t outside for very long. I realized that I should get outside more often and be with the nature around me. It was nice to take a deep breath and feel that it was fresh air. It was as if I didn\'t have anything to worry about; my anxieties were gone. I was able to forget about them for awhile. I just sat and watched the things around me: the animals, the trees in the wind, the clouds in the sky, and the few people that walked by. I felt like in that time, I was trying to relax myself so I could enjoy the moment even more.

I would just be staring at nothing and not even thinking about anything. I feel very relaxed.

1313^NR^O^activity2^The place I chose to spend time at was the Rideau canal. Since my first year at university it has always been a place where I could get away to. I usually do some form of exercise while visiting, and this time I chose to roller blade. While rollerblading along the canal I always notice the beauty of nature, and I happened to notice that several ducks like to take naps on the side of the canal since it has been lowered since I have last been there. My emotions seem calmer somehow when I\'m on the pathway beside the canal, and I seem to be able to process things more clearly and rationally. It also makes me nostalgic because seeing the canal reminds me of the water by my cottage, which reminds me of my family and homesickness. However being on the canal is also the time where I love to be alone. I am usually a very social person but I just feel like sometimes I need a break and that on the canal I can just be myself with no one to impress and nothing to live up to. I also feel great after having completed exercise outdoors as there is just no other feeling like it.

When i go i like to watch people ride their horses. I really miss it, i wish i could afford to own a horse and have enough time to go out everyday and just spend time there. Although lots of drama and chaos happens there its still such a wonderful place to be. When I go there i always think of my instructor, well ex-instructure since im currently not riding.. and how she wants a new job to buy her dream horse. I also looked at all the familiar horses noticing that none have been sold in quite a long time due to the bad economy, the horses there are exceptionnally expensive as well.. I walk around looking at the horses seeing familiar faces. Ah well, hopefully ill ride soon.

1316^CC^O^activity2^It was very quiet, and I was able to listen some Kenny G\'s saxaphone flowing through my earphones. This music put me in a very relaxed mood and without even knowing it, I was in a zone where it seemed as if I was meditating. As I was there I could hear every detailed sound in the room. From the humming sound caused by the refrigerator to the fan spinning in my laptop, and even people passing and laughing outside my window.   I was able to see every crack in the unfinished, unpainted wall as it seemed dull and cold. Then, in that area adjoining the unfinished wall to the finished wall was my poster of Usain Bolt who I used to compete against back in high school, which helps to motivate me at times. Then I looked at the black green and gold flag of Jamaica which is beside the poster, I wish I was there by the beaches even now, seeing how cold it is about to get in Canada. Then I started to remember the long days I used to have in practice on the track, and also on the soccer field, but at the end of practice I always had some refreshing coconut water.

The trees had lost most of their leaves, but there was still some fall colour around.  There was a smell of fall in the air.  Leaves were underfoot.  The houses were mostly of the earliest 29th century.  The water had been drained from the canal, a sign of winter coming and early preparations for ice skating.  I was glad to be in fresh air, getting some modest exercise, and catching up with my brother.  This was the contentment I wanted in my life.

I felt like all of my stresses from University and work were gone and I was free for that hour taht I just sat there, thinking, in silence.

I closed my eyes for a while and simply tried to enjoy being outside. I relaxed my body into the ground and tree trunk.My mind was washed of thoughts and I simply sat with myself in my own world. When this happened I re-opened my eyes and observed from a distant place. I did not truly process everything but rather let it wash over me. I simply observed people going about there day and sometimes wondered about their lives. I looked at the trees and noticed how they had changed since the first time I was there. Despite noticing things I did not feel a very strong emotion, but one of relaxed and slow content. It was as if by sitting there I could simply let the world go by and watch as it progressed. I did not have any stress and could enjoy being by myself outside.

We woke up slowly and were just happy to be in each others\' arms for a while. I stayed in bed while he made breakfast and brought it back to his room. We hung out in bed talking and laughing for a few hours. He then had to do some house cleaning so I stayed in his bed and watched a lecture I\'d rented on DVD. He would take breaks from cleaning to come back and watch the lecture every now and then. He made me smile just by walking in the room. After my lecture, he made lunch which he burned. It wasn\'t the most delicious but I didn\'t mind. My only thought was that he was adorable. This relfection is giving me warm feelings inside, like the warm bed on the rainy day. Thanks

1343^NR^O^activity2^I spent a half an hour sitting by the canal with a friend to study. It was very peaceful and relaxing. It was chilly, which made me feel very calm. I noticed the colour of the trees across the canal and the movement of the water, which had a very calming effect. I thought about how much I was enjoying my time at school, how much I have accomplished since I have been here. It also made me miss my entire family, my parents and sister, but also my extended family: aunts, uncles, cousins, all of whom I hadn\'t seen in a while. Sitting out by the canal made me think of them and the longing I have to see them. Looking out over the canal also made me think of how much those people mean to me. I also found myself thinking about Christmas time, when all of my family will be together and enjoying each other\'s company. I also remember thinking about how simple life appeared from that particular aspect - the calm water and the colourful trees. It was very soothing and calming.

I remember vividly sweating and feeling quite tired - however, the post-play rest was very relaxing. I took a few sips (with some big gulps there and there) of water. The playing reminded me of those schoolyard days when I used to be far more fit and better at the sport. With a little bit more practice, I feel I can enjoy myself out on these outdoor courts often and regain some skill that\'ll put myself back on track in terms of my fitness goals - and in term, help build my confidence back up and feel a bit better about my health.

Outiside I can see a massive amount of toilet paper in trees and on the roof as someone tp\'d the campus over night 2 nights ago. I at first laughed and found it hilarious that someone did it and then it turned into thinking people are stupid and wasted alot of good toilet paper and made a mess. I also heard a dispute between two male individuals at 3am which caused me and many to wake up and I was very angered. Over all in the past few days I have experienced many emotions while sitting at this desk and being on my computer both good and bad.

1354^CC^O^activity2^I chose to spend time just sitting and relaxing, not thinking about school or drama or anything.  I did this in my room while listening to relaxing music in order to completely escape from reality.  In doing this, I had a realization that I am a really priveleged person, and despite things that my parents have had to go through they have always made sure that I was able to grow up and live a comfortable worry-free lifestyle.  It makes me value life a little more and I feel like I should do something to help those who didn\'t/don\'t have the luxuries that I have. It makes me extremely happy and extremely sad at the same time.

1198^CC^O^activity2^The one calm and relaxing place indoors that I was comfortable at was in my room. My bed is nice and warm and it makes me feel reflective when I crawl into bed and just relax and breathe. I felt at ease and that worrying about school work and other things wasn\'t imprtant. I felt as if I should just sleep for a long time in order to rejuvinate and feel alive again. The one thing I noticed when I was in my room was the hand creames and face clenser\'s sitting neatly on the night table. It felt nice to seem them there neatly. Made me feel more comfortable because I felt I had kept the apartment up and clean. Some of my deep feelings and deep thoughts that roamed in m head while I snuggled there was how long I would have to be away from the rest of my family. How many more arguments was my sister going to have with me until she finally decided to do something with her life? How many more times was I going to stay awake at night thinking about how hard i have to work in order to do well at university. And how many more tears will I have to shed until I am finally feeling high-spirited. Then when I hear my brothers walk in I feel as if my time to myself is over and I get out of my blanket. Fix my bed and leave the room, which I will return to soon enough...to contemplate again.

The last time I can remember relaxing and spending time for my self was while I was watching my favorite TV show and cooking dinner. I did not experience any deep thoughts as I was consumed with everything around me, but it was the one place that I was able to let loose and just relax .. sorta

The walls are a deep shade of red but there are chips off the paint in the wall near my bed from where the edge of my laptop has hit it when i watch tv on my bed. The floor is covered in clothes and there are 4 towels on the chair beside my desk. I was frustrated with my friend for yelling at me and tired from the fight. I wanted to go to sleep, but couldn\'t fall asleep because I didn\'t want to go to bed angry at my friend. Sitting there made me more angry, and I ended up thinking I as more mad than I actually was. I cleaned my whole room, cleaning takes my mind off of what was bothering me. I work the best at night too, when no one comes in to bug me or talk to me. The clean room made me feel like I had accomplished something, and tired me out. I fell asleep not as mad at my friend.

1357^NR^O^activity2^The vast majority of my time outdoors recently has taken place while I was on my way to class.  Because I have lived my entire life (up until this semester) in Vancouver, the things that most commonly stand out to me are the cold, the wind, and the brilliant sunsets.  When these things take place at the same time, I find myself conflicted.  I take a lot of joy in appreciating the spectacle of some of the sunsets here, and there are few good indoor places to enjoy them on campus, but I find it extremely unpleasant to stay outdoors in the increasingly frequent cold weather.  A particular occurrence in the quad a few weeks ago has left a lasting image in my mind:  the wind was quite strong, and because of the architecture there were eddies everywhere.  Dozens of leaves from the ground were suspended, whirling around, well above the buildings in the quad.  I had to limit my mesmerization to moments as I was in a rush to get to a lecture, but it stands among a very select collection of mental images that I believe will stay with me forever.  I had planned to go to a particular place on campus to truly appreciate nature (something I haven\'t done for a long time), but I didn\'t have a chance to before the call to take this survey came.  Hopefully I can go on thursday, as I planned, before the next update arrives.

I feel happiest when my cats greet me with a \"chirp\" noise.  I love to close my eyes and listen.  I feel most at ease with my eyes closed.  I don\'t tend to think about much other then the things that have happened throughout the day that I enjoyed and made me feel at ease.  When relaxing in a comfortable place, I feel at ease, content, I just feel happy.  I know I have somewhere to be me, to keep to myself and reflect on the day.

Surrounded by trees you get a sense of life and true fresh air. The leaves are changing and falling makes me both content but also a little sad. Its a beautiful sight to see how much nature can change so fast and the effects it can have on you. It makes me a little sad because I know that winter is coming and it\'s not my favorite season. But all in all being outside allows you to feel fresh air and nature\'s surroundings without having to deal with the all the loud sounds of the city.

There was something about the sound of the water that made me so calm. Just looking at how beautiful nature could be made me so happy. It brought me back to simpler times when i used to live in Richmond Hill and there was a little river by the park and i\'d sit there with my mom looking at the water and the ducks. It was sunny and quite warm out so i didn\'t need a jacket. I wasn\'t listening to music and i was alone, it was my alone time; my time to think about everything that\'s going on in my life. Lately, i haven\'t been able to have much time to think because of all the things that i have to do and it was nice to finally clear my head, get my thoughts into order. Just sitting by the canal made me feel so happy. I don\'t get to realx much and this was just what i needed. I find myself thinking clearer when i do my homework.

Today, is Rememberance Day and I am very grateful for where I am today and for those who fought to make it possible.

It feels just like home because it is lived in (messy) just like my room back home, so I guess it helps with the little bit of homesickness. This is probably the most alluring thing about it because if it were to be very clean it would not seem like it was actually my room. There are posters on the wall that I chose, so it adds a touch of personalization, and my shelf is full of supplies and decorations that make it all the more homely.  I feel warm and safe in here, and also very relaxed because it is my little piece of the school.

1407^NR^O^activity2^Sitting next to a river, I watched the ducks come and go. Some people fed them bread and I watched as they happily ate them. The deepest thought that hit me was how fragile and short life is. There is never enough time to enjoy all the beauty this world has to offer or to experience it all. Sometimes we take for granted the small things, such as sitting by a lake and watching the ripples the water make as the ducks swim by. Sometimes we are too pre-occupied with being busy and living life that we actually don\'t stop and look around us. Life just passes us by without actually living it. I felt that I should stop worrying so much. Problems come and go. I should deal with them when they come and not spend hours worrying about them coming.

1382^CC^O^activity2^While lying in bed after waking up I had two dominant streams of emotion coursing through me.  On the one hand, the book I was reading (\"Infinite Jest\" by David Foster Wallace) and the music I was listening to (\"White Light/White Heat\" by The Velvet Underground) filled me with a deep sense of awe with respect to the artistic capabilities of people.  It inspired a feeling a oneness within me (with respect to being between myself and other people past ad present) as I was aware that others were inspired as I was being inspired by the same artistic artifacts.  Likewise, the knowledge that average people had created such incredible pieces of artistry encouraged my own belief that I too may be capable of such things.  However, I was then filled with deep feelings of sadness and inadequacy as I subsequently began to believe that, for one such as myself, such creations are impossible because I have neither the ability nor the determination.  This was followed by guilt and remorse as I was suddenly aware that I would not be able to fulfill the promise of a life that many view as sacred.

1383^NR^O^activity2^I suppose that recently the one place I\'ve spent time outdoors would have been on campus. It was last week on one of the days where the temperature reached over 15 degrees which feels all the more warm considering it is November. Sitting outdoors always gives me a sense of peace, and provides many things for me to observe. While I try to do work I generally just end up distracted. On this particular occasion staring at the river and watching people walk by was much more interesting than the stats reading I should have been doing. It was early afternoon and the sun was beating quite strongly, surprisingly there were still many ducks in the river. I remember hoping that the warm weather hadnt thrown off their internal clocks. I spent a lot of time simply observing people around me which always seems to calm me, and allow my mind to wander either in creative ways, such as making up stories about the people I see, or just allow myself to destress and start thinking about the state of my personal life and happiness. This strain of thought usually deals with trying to figure out my interpersonal relationships and where I stand. Lately I\'ve also spent a lot of time wondering what it is I\'m going to do when I leave the life of a student and enter the real world, and whether or not my ambitions are too much for what I can actually accomplish.

1369^NR^O^activity2^I chose to spend time in my backyard lookin at the dying flowers.  This made me feel sad as all the beautiful flowers i loved watching grow during the summer and spring die.  I felt free when I was here, my mind was fresh and free from disturbing thoughts. I sat there rejuvinating it was impressing how nature made me feel on this particular day. Normally I don\'t take note of nature as much. I would just walk by the plants smile and walk off. But this particular day I sat there thinking of how happy plants must be. They don\'t have to worry about life. No exams to think about or any assignments due, nothing! They just grow, mature, spread their seeds all around and let the next generation take over. I was thinkig of how It would be if I had to be a sunflower for a day. I would love the living part but worry when I start to wilt. Maybe even worry about the seasins that ome and go to. This is where I started to notice the value of life. After watching the dehydrated flowers reaching for water I felt reluctant and ceontent that when it came to that, humans can reach for their own water instead of waiting for it to get to them like the dependant plants. When it comes to the cold we can shelter ourselves and provide clothing to wistand the weather. This really amused me. For a long while I thanked God for giving me a soul and all my limbs. What can flowers do? Nothing except for be beautiful and bloom and die in pain as they reach for their last breath. Being beautiful is not the only thing one needs to live for a long while.  Thank God!

1379^NR^O^activity2^I walked to the park which is quite close to my house. I live downtown so its not the most scenic place. There\'s a large fountain in a generally open area lined with paths, some strips of green and a couple of trees. The park is surrounded by some busy streets. I remember seeing a woman with a large dog. She was circling around the park. One woman talked with her and they crossed paths. I kept wondering if they were arguing or simply talking about the dog in an admiring way. I felt slightly insecure being all alone on a park bench simply viewing the park as if from a third party. The car lights from the street kept glaring out of the corner of my eye and I was expecting to see one of the cars driving on the sidewalk towards me. I thought about what it would look like from an outsiders perspective to see a young woman sitting on a park bench all alone. There were some trucks parked in the street. They were from a theatre company. I thought about what kind of show was in town. It was very cold. I was writing some self-help questions and listening to some music. I felt very detached from what was going on. It was cold too and I wanted to leave most of the time. My pen kept dying while I was trying to write and that was frustrating me. I was there for about 20 minutes. I stuck it through. I am guessing that it was still too busy and city like for me to really enjoy nature. Or what scarce amount there was in the park. It wasn\'t very enjoyable.

I ran around lookin at the trees, water and the little animals. I find that running is very relaxing and that it helps me plan activites and think about me. I notoved the vibrant (Sorry as I was doing this I am cooking) I feel very at hoem when I am in nature. I grew up in a small town and I used to run in the fields. It makes me feel comfortable and alone.I realy like running outside but I do not do it anough. I feel that when I am outside I can clear my mind, focus and problem solve.

1403^NR^O^activity2^I went to the canal and sat there on the edge by the water. It was a cool, windy night, and there were ducks in the water. It was nice because the fresh air really rejuvinated me. I became a little cynical as the cool air hit my face, and my hands were freezing. I thought about how quickly everything had changed here at carleton, and how different everything was when it was warm outside. Some people we met at the beginning of the year really turned out differently than we had expected. After wards though, when thoughts of how fun the winter will be to skate on the canal and go snowboarding with my friends.

It made me feel free and far away from the day to day craziness and relaxed. I also felt at peace.

1413^NR^O^activity2^I took a walk in the Carleton University campus. I was not feeling all right. I was depressed. I was thinking when I am depressed or sad why there is no one to give me support. it happens every time when I am really sad. But then I was thinking that this makes me strong, really strong. Then I was thinking about my childhood that how much time did my mom and dad gave me. not much. currently i am in a relationship and my boy friend has no time for me when i am sad but rest of the time he has time for me. then i was what am i doing right now and what am i gaetting in return. what i am achieving right now is not bad but have to better. i was thinking about how build a strong relationship with family, friend, boyfriend. it is hard to maintain everything but not impossible and i can handle it.

1131^NR^O^activity2^I noticed the sun and how it shines through the trees. In spite of how down I\'ve been feeling, seeing nature and its beauty gives me comfort. I noticed the leaves as the squirrels run over them. Everything seems so simple when your surrounded by nature. It gives you a chance to lose yourself and forget about everything that is going wrong. I wish that I could have lived in a time when nature was a bigger part of our live. When life was more simple. The air is chilly but it makes me feel alive. The Carleton campus can sometimes make you forget that you\'re in the city, until you hear all the cars and the planes. I miss being home in the country, where I can just sit outside with my cat and listen to nothing.

1378^CC^O^activity2^Bedroom   annoyed with people talking above me while I try to work. It makes me mad and irratated.  Sad being here and leaving those that i love at home. I remember on September 1st when they dropped me off and I tried really hard not to cry.  I rememeber this room when we were coming to look aat the house. The bed was very low to the ground aand he had a big stuffed animal sitting on the bed.   I notice how cold the room is but i really like how it has wood flooring thats why I choose it.  Fun summer experience here where my current boyfriend and I became offical and spent 3 days here. My favourite thing was to go online and play each other music that we really liked while the other one listened.

Don\'t know what else to say either than this place makes me feel younger and alive/

1415^NR^O^activity2^I went to the river close to my school, where the water meets the rocks. There is a large grassy area with a bench. Watching and listening to the water made me feel calmer. I\'ve been extremely stressed since October and being here made me rethink about everything I am stressed about. Being in a new country is definitley hard. The culture is so different and I\'m finding it hard to fit in. School work is also being a hassle, especially with being a first year journalism student. The thought of the cut at the end of the year is a really scary. Being alone by the river really helps me to reevaluate everything and gives me a chance to be myself. I came up with some solutions for my personal stresses and issues. I figured out what I was doing wrong and where I am lacking. I figured out that I need to get my confidence back. I came up with a set of steps to help me regain my confidence which I wrote down on the notebook I carry around with me.

1391^NR^O^activity2^The quiet relaxing place for me is while walking to the corner store or to the bus stop. I do not have a specific area where I go to, however I find that simply walking relaxes me, especially walking while listening to music. I think walking to the grocery store is a bit more relaxing as I don\'t have to rush to make it in time to catch the bus. The walk takes about 15 minutes at a moderate pace and is calming because it includes a stretch of quiet scenic area as well as a familiar comforting and populated area. While walking I feel refreshed and am able to think and reflect. Part of the area reminds me of Vancouver and as I often feel homesick, this helps me feel more at home.

1398^CC^O^activity2^I have found a cafe in the heart of the Byward market that I absolutely adore. There is a very leisurely feel and an air of casualty around everyone. Inside the cafe, the lighting is low, there are warm, bright colors that are comforting and stimulating. The conversations that take place there are ones that revolve around cultural experiences, such as plays, literature, music, etc. They make all of their own pastries behind the counter so to room always smells of shortcake batter. I can completely unwind when I am there. You can sit alone for hours and not be bothered or judged. There\'s no pressure, no stress, no worries. The music is always incredibly soothing and different: very indie-oriented. If there was one cafe in the city where hippies and socialites mingle, this would be the place. I always enjoy myself there, but it\'s more than good conversation and good food, it\'s a brilliant atmosphere and a sophisticated lounge for people who want to be intellectual. Something in comparison to a winery.

1387^NR^O^activity2^I walk out the door of my house and put in my Ipod earplugs and set a playlist of my choosing. I then walk towards the park. It is cold and clouldy today. I have on my new jacket that looks like a sports player would wear. As I walk down the road towards the park, I notice that almost no one else is outside. That maybe because it is dark outside and it is 8 o\'clock. I finally reach the park in about 10 minutes walk. I then go to the swings. As I am swinging, I look at the sky and start to be inspired by the starry night. The trees around me are quiet, some of them have been cut down. In the soccer field, preparations for winter have begun. Borders are being built for a skating rink for the children to play hockey as well as university students to hangout. As I think about these things, I think about myself, my friends, the girl I have a crush on, the stress of university and the chores back home. After half an hour, I get off the swing and walk back home..i am listening to song that to me tells me to get back up whenever I fall down.

My puppy also stays in my bedroom generally, which makes me feel loved and happy. It is clean, but filled with various things, which makes me feel orginal and organized. I can accomplish more in this space then others, because it is my own and i am very familiar with it.

1399^NR^O^activity2^I spent an hour by myself walking through the woods behind my house. I was looking for some time to clear my head and think about as little as possible. Being outside makes me feel so alive and free, like nothing in the world can touch me. It interesting to see the many different animals moving about, chimpmunks, birds,rabbits. I was even able to see a deer in my travels. I experienced many emotions while on my walk, including happiness for the time I was able to take to clear my head, as well as frustration, thinking about life in general, as well as school and my current 6 year relationship. All and all my walk allowed me to escape from my real world and enjoy the beautiful outdoors and all of its\' creatures.

1395^NR^O^activity2^I sat there on a bench admiring the surroundings; filled with a few giant trees and pathways for people to walk without stepping on grass or mud. There were many people scurrying around heading off in many directions. Then I wondered why people were always in a rush? Often these people rarely look up and \"see\" the sky. Which at this moment was a little cloudy but one could still see bits of the blue seeping through. Suddenly the thought of Superman came into my mind, and how he required the sun to energize himself to gather his strength. Instinctively, i mimicked this by closing my eyes briefly and took a breath, imagining the sun\'s light was being absorbed into my body and providing myself strength. Then the wind blew out and a sudden realization of staying outside too long will leave me cold. Though, the fresh cool air was always better than going into the stale air of closed buildings. Then i suddenly thought i saw her walking on the far side of the atrium. Was it possible? The chances were against me, and then the notion of getting up and heading towards my class internally ranged in my head. Perhaps another time will surely present itself for me to pursue the truth. But when will this happen? If I return this very spot, there was no way my wanting will affect the outcome of the function of this reality. Instead, i will have to play it off and expect the unexpected will bring a new outlook on what can happen to me. Suddenly I\'m reminded of what my friend had heard another friend said to him. A quote, \"hold on to the things that make you want to kill yourself\". What a deep quote. Hearing this quote sort of kicked me back into what i had to do to contribute to this world with my creativity. The sense of doubts of my talent and skill started to pass away and the invisible veil started to rise. Was this happiness? I wasn\'t sure, no it was just a taste of what happiness could be.

When I relax I think about home and my grandma\'s cooking (back in spain).

It was cold outside, so I was bundled up in my winter jacket. It was nice though, even with the cold, it was nice to sit and reflect on the way my life is going, the good things and the bad. I sat and contemplated school and if the program I was in was really what I wanted to be doing. I sat and pondered my boyfriend and our long distance relationship and how it was working out. Mostly I sat and pondered about life itself and how fascinating it is that things can turn out the way you wanted them to or they don\'t.

1432^CC^O^activity2^In my Bedroom...  Light colours of my room help me to relax. Laptop is turned off to give me a break from thinking about school and assignments. The radio is on, Hot 89.9- my favourite station. I\'m lying on my bed, its warm and soft, thinking about my plan to do a semester abroad next year. I\'m worried about money, but I try to calculate how much I need to work to earn enough. I wonder if I will need to find a new job that will pay more, a second job for the summer, or if that one I\'m at now will be enough. I think I\'ll be ok with the one I\'m at now, but I\'ll have to see. Then I worry about being away from home for the first time. I have never been outside of Canada, much less across half the world. I am determined though, I know I can make friends easily and I am confident that I have the independence to be away from home for four monthes. Besides, my family has always wanted to do a family trip to Europe, they can come visit. Either way, I am determined to get there.

1426^CC^O^activity2^My indoor place that I chose was my room. The reason I choose this place is because its somewhere I can be myself, and feel happy in. I can think deep thoughts in my room alone, no stress no worries. I can get a lot of work done in my room also. The other day I was thinking about how I would study for 3 midterms, and still have time to do my assignments. This put me in a hard position, but I was able to manage time constraints inorder to get my work done, thanks to sitting in my indoor place and thinking.

I notice the sky, a clear blue, cloudless day with the sun shining.  There are ducks, geese and some other birds.  I feel calm, I\'m letting go of my concerns and tuning into my surroundings.  I\'m  breathing deeply, and relaxing my posture, tuning into my body.  I\'m aware of my thoughts and relaxing  some more.      As I\'m writing now, I feel more relaxed.  I woke up tense this morning, but feel more relaxed and calm.  As I tune into my breathing, I\'m relaxed.

1437^NR^O^activity2^Recently I lost someone very close to me and I have many regrets regarding my relationship with him. Sitting in a quiet place at this point is torture. I sat and I looked around trying to relax and enjoy the surroundings for what they are but I find myself looking at the time to see if I can leave and get busy. I cannot sit quietly without becoming sad and thinking about what I have lost. This is not the way I normally am, and I hope I don\'t stay this way. Normally I can enjoy quiet, reflective time and I can relax easily, especially in nature, but at the moment, I don\'t even see it. I don\'t look around me anymore and appreciate my surroundings. When I am with my kids however, I am able to do this, I point things out to them and they do the same to me, as long as I am not alone, I don\'t get stuck inside my head with all the memories.

1422^CC^O^activity2^I spend alot of time in my room. I feel so sad and depressed due to a number of reason. When l am feeling sad, is when l shut myself in my room and completely isolate myself. I have lots of clothes, shoes and everything materialistic that l could possibly want but there is still a void. It is not enough, l am never satisfied. I am always searching , but never seem to find the piece that will make me happy. I feel so lonely , yet the world looks at me and see a beautiful, intelligent woman that has it all, but l feel so hurt and sad. Will l ever to be happy? Will l always be this way? I avoid being in my room, alot because that is when l start thinking and analyzing so l keep busy,with work, school and trivial things.

Most of the time that I\'m in here I think about school work and the things that I need to get done. I also listen to music and do a lot of resting. this is because I spend most of my nights awake and I sleep during the day or I\'m in class. I just remember feeling extremely comfortable and at ease.

1423^NR^O^activity2^I spent a few hours with a friend raking leaves at a condominium complex.  It was a nice day outside, failry cool, but not cold enough to prevent us from being there.  There were tons of leaves everywhere, and I mean everywhere.  I really did not want to be there, as we were working, and raking leaves is not the most fun of jobs to do, but it was not that bad in the long run.  The worst part about it was bagging the leaves, a real pain in the ass.  We spent a few hours doing all this work, and had to cut it off short, leaving a few houses still full of leaves.  It was not the most fun experience I have ever had, but it\'s all done now.  It was a pretty boring day in the long run, and I would probably not sign up for such a job in the future.

1188^CC^O^activity2^For my comfortable place I chose my room at home.  The time was 10:00 PM and I was going to bed.  I felt relaxed because I was about to go to sleep.  I was tired but felt good about what I had accomplished during the day.  The room was dark, and pretty much empty.  There was some clothes on the floor but everything else was clean.  The blinds were closed and the only lights on in the room were the small green light from my phone and a little light coming in from under the blind.  It was very quiet, all I could hear was my dad breathing heavily as he slep next door.  I was thinking about how good and relaxed I was feeling, and how I am truly capable of doing whatever I want.

1227^NR^O^activity2^Last weekend i went home to the country to take care of my house and cats while my parents were away on vacation. I spent a lot of time outside playing with my brothers dog and really taking in the slow atmosphere of the country. I\'ve never felt so great to be able to be somewhere, where there isnt constant work and stress. As well, simply not being in the mode of \"rush\", was awesome. The cool country fresh air, and the sound of nothing, has never been so relaxing. I\'ve never felt so at peace to be home. The way to field swayed with the wind, has never had such a calming effect on me, and i came to realize how much i miss and love the outdoors. Being outside allowed me to reflect on what i\'ve been working on so hard to achieve. Being with nature, helped me respect what ive been doing, and also completely relax me; allowing me to feel more open to my own feelings.

I thought about a book i just read moslty called \"under the bridge\" it was very thought provoking. I think about my debt and that stresses me outa bit but i just tell my self I\'ll work and pay it off and it\'ll eventually go down. I love the way my room is painted so it makes me happy. I think about my boyfriend and go on the internet and play video games. usually I\'m content in my room it calms me down, in the past three weeks i\'ve spent most of   my time there just relaxing and thinking about life and people.

1439^NR^O^activity2^I decided to notice the features around me while coming home from school.  I actually spend a lot of time on the o-train but i really enjoy it, sometimes wish it was a bit longer. I take in the underpassing river and the trees and scenery from south keys to carleton and sometimes (like today) i travelled farther just to sit and think.  So as i got off the train i took a walk past my house. I took notice of the trees and how all the leaves have fallen off. I also noticed that there were fewer people because it was a bit cold outside. I then spotted a cat and called it over. Eventually it came and i sat with it for 5 or 10 minutes just letting it rub up against me while I pet it and somewhat had a lattle shat with the animal.  It then became cold so i turned around. While taking my walk a had my music on for most of the time, except with the cat. With my music i thought about what i had to do for the rest of the evening such as homework and what to have for dinner.   I dont seem to focus to much on the future any farther then a few days ahead. This is something a have to do or I will stress too much about future events and due dates (however i do plan far enough ahead at certain times in order to complete necessary projects, etc.  Taking a walk for me is like a healing process. If i am really angry i take a walk, if i need to think, i take a walk, even if i am just bored ill take a walk or hop on a bus to somewhere just to think and get away.  I usually think about life and how lucky i am (once i get over my anger, etc.) I then get inspired or my thoughts just become happy.  These little times out of my day help in healing letting go of any stresses that are in my way.

1411^NR^O^activity2^On the deck:  Usually sitting out on the deck is a social affair. I am not currently enjoying the weather but I have many friends and room mate who smoke and I chose to go outside to enjoy their company. It is often dark early so there is not much to see. I live in a series of townhomes so my view is an exact replicate of the home I live in. I am completely surrounded by dull, drab, best-bang-for-your-buck architecture of townhomes. There are few children in the area - mostly students and young couples or older people with low incomes. The only thing that comes to mind when I analyze my surrounding is how much I can\'t wait to move back to the end of town I grew up in. I\'ve lived here a year now and the only thing that can give this area any sense of beauty is the summer sun and green leaves. The leaves now have fallen and the bare branches do not help the lack of curb appeal this neighbourhood has. I see homes where old neighbours and old friends have left - leaving a vacant home in my direct line of view. It is sad to see a place once so warm and welcoming now so deserted. The skies are grey and any view beyond the the neighbourhood is obstructed by highrise buildings surrouding the area. There are few animals in the neighbourhood and there is much to be desired as far as landscaping is concerned. Most of the homes in this neighbourhood have beer gardens rather then foliage. In the dark of night, the only sounds you will hear are phones ringing through the paper thin walls of other townhomes or drunk students hollering at one another in the streets. Dispite that, the first snow fall had happened and the reminence of sparkling snow is mildly appealing, although it only reminds me just how cold it is going to get very quickly.

1430^CC^O^activity2^The other night i was in my dormroom and was lieing in my bed but i could not fall asleep. I had waken up late that morning so i knew i would have trouble getting to sleep that night. I then proceeded to read one of my coursebooks in an attempt to help me fall asleep, it was around 3 in the mornign adn i felt somewhat tired so i tried to fall asleep. i tosses and turned for a couple hours but there were to many thoughts circulating in my head about school work, events happening in res, christmas coming up and my ex boyfriend back at home along with family. I was extremlly concerned that i wouldnt be able to wake up for my class the next day, whcih seemed to make me even more anxious. I was feeling tense and sort of energetic. I decided to write in my journal to get these thoughts out of my head and maybeit would help me fall asleep. I decided that i was going to write poems for each members of my family for christmas, i ended up writting about really emotional situations they went through adn struggles. That then made me feel really emotional and i began to reflect on the struggles in my life that related to ones of my family. I ended up staying up untill 7 in the morning when iheard my canmate getting up to go to the gym, i thought about going and decided it might help me fall asleep, even though i knew it was to late to get any decent amount of sleep. coming back i felt sick and plopped in my bed, still finding it difficult to fall asleep, i began to intently think about my ex boyfriend and i began to get emotional. When i finally fell asleep i missed my class and woke up feeling determined to catch up on my school work and figure some stuff out in my life. Through that experience i felt that sometimes taking a break to reflect on aspects of your life really help you figure out your feelings about certain situations and people in your life. Even if this reflection is forced on you at a time you dont want it to, in the end it helped me begin to work through som stuff.

When I am in my dorm room, I am not very productive because it feels too stress free. When I am in my dorm, i notice the messiness and the sounds that are going on outside of my room. I listen to the conversation that through the wall from next door, the banging of doors and the sound of the television across the hall. When I lay in my bed for long enough my mind begins to drift off into ideas that I need to come up in order to win a contest that I decided to participate in on Monday. I am very distracted by this and is on my mind for the time I am lying in my room. I also think about what I would feel like if i won the contest and what it would be like to experience the prize. As i type out what I was feeling, I am feeling the same emotions.

As a student a quiet place to study is necessary to be successful. I felt very content to realize i had that place.

At that moment I had committed a dreadful mistake that I was not aware of until later, and though this mistake might have been catastrophic I am still not worried about the situation. While I was there some interesting stories were told they were happy and made me laugh I cannot remember the stories I just know they were funny.

1447^NR^O^activity2^Walking along Bank St in the Glebe. It was cold and wet and rainy but it was still nice to be outside. I got off a stuffy bus a lot sooner than i had to just so i could get some fresh air. there really aren\'t of trees along the street, its quite narrow and packed with all sorts of building, but its not very cosmopolitan, it feels like main street in a small town. i was thinking that my friends better love me for making a alcohol run for them. thats about it. been inside alot more than i should this last week.

1405^NR^O^activity2^Sometimes I enjoy sitting in my backyard and relaxing. Even though I am in the city, it\'s still very quiet and peaceful. I can hear the birds while I read or do homework. If the weather is nice, I can put my feet in the pool or even relax while floating in the pool. Even though I\'d rather be around people, studying in my backyard let\'s me be very productive and not stressed as if I was in a mall or somewhere similar.

1386^CC^O^activity2^I sat in the room that I sleep in. It also has the computer where I spent most of my days trying to work on my essays but failing miserably. I can\'t seem to concentrate and get distracted VERY easily. It is a research project so I always find myself surfing the net rather than looking for actual sources. A lot of this is because I look at the progress I made and realize that not much has changed which depresses me and makes me avoid working longer. I felt like I couldn\'t concentrate at all, even thought it\'s the most relaxed place I can be. I felt physically tired, which is probably because it\'s freezing in the house. While I was there I thought about how much I needed to do and how I really need to get the room and house organized, but I really don\'t have the time. I decided to type my thoughts on a word document and then delete the document which really helped for a while. I spent most of my time listening to music or talking on MSN. This is pretty strange, I doubt anyone is actually writing anything this detailed. My friends all seemed to have a focus on their essays and get their work done which made me wonder why I couldn\'t seem to concentrate. My friend kept reminding me to work via MSN though, which on hindsight helped me a lot that night.

1424^CC^O^activity2^I never used to be a fan of wallpaper, but that\'s simply because the patterns available looked like a posy plucked from Aunt Myrtle\'s garden. Now you can find bright, bold, overscaled contemporary prints that leave the English Country aesthetic in the dust.   My goal with my living room is to see how many people I can squeeze in for a party configuration. I\'m not one to host a dinner for six (12-30 is more my style), and I like to be sure everyone has a place to perch when cocktails are being served. This is why I love using a daybed in a living room. On lazy weekend afternoons it offers the best place to stretch out and read the paper, but in the midst of the party it\'s deep enough for guests to sit on either side and can accommodate up to six people.The best rooms have a combination of old and new. No one wants their living room to look like it was the showroom special and selecting vintage pieces ensures that your living room will not look like all the others on your street. I found an incredible bar cart, funky faux bamboo chairs, sleek rosewood coffee table, fab 60\'s candelabra and cool Scandinavian light fixture for less than I\'d have to pay if they were new, and as an added bonus these finds will retain their value (or appreciate) as the years go by!

1435^NR^O^activity2^The place was near campus, close to the river. It\'s beautiful and calm especially to study. I was there to actually study away from all distractions which can come across because it\'s on campus therefore there are always lots of people like friends around. There were lots of trees and benches to sit and eat. There were lots of trees and the river was extremely calm as it made noises of waves. My feelings were relaxed and focused as I was studying and it\'s the time of year to get really concentrated and focus on all your school work to get all those readings done. It was wonderful to be with a friend to study, and it was quite interesting how both my friend and I pointed out the outdoors nature to be relaxing and calming. It was quite wonderful, and I\'m sure it\'s even better in the summer season.

1449^NR^O^activity2^truthfully, i do most of my thinking while in the shower.  I think about my friends back home and how much a miss them. I try to talk to at least one of them everyday, even if i just text them.  I am thinking of changing universities, not only to be closer to them, but so I can feel like I am wanted, and so I can enjoy school again(as much as that is possible haha). I think about school and how horrible i\'m doing in it.  I just want the new year to begin, so I can try start over again...this is my life and i am paying a lot of money for all of this, and so far all i have done is pretty much failed everything that i\'ve done.  I watched a video the other day on YouTube about this guy and his \"last lecture\", it made me feel like crap.  I\'ve never had any childhood dreams, and I\'ve never really known what i want to do with my life, I\'ve never really had an interest in anything, no real hobbies, it made me feel like a boring person.  Anyhow, thats what the shower made me think about...there are definitely happy moments in my life, don\'t get me wrong, i\'m just having a bit of trouble lately dealing with university. But hey! Isn\'t that what first year is for? Learning new things about yourself and learning from your mistakes?  Well I learned that I need friends to keep me going, and that I need to try a lot harder in school.  I don\'t know if that is exactly what you were looking for me to write, but that felt good haha.

1451^NR^O^activity2^Today when I was walking to class I walked outside while it was slightly drizzling. There was not a lot of nature to take in due to the fact that I live on campus and the majority of the campus is buildings. However, I did stop to briefly sit on a bench in a grass area with some trees. I thought about the rain and how I didn\'t like it, and how the weather is becoming cold. I hate winter and the coldness really bothers me. I would much rather have summer because I hate the snow. I thought about last winter and what a hassle snow and ice is. I felt cold and the rain was bothering me. There weren\'t many people around since it was raining and everyone walks inside. I began to think about home and how I wondered if it was raining there and how I wouldn\'t have to be outside if it was. The thought of home made me sad momentairily, but the feeling passed. I also noticed there were not any animals around except a few squirrels. One squirrel kept running near where I was sitting. It began to rain instead of drizzle so I decided to go back to residence and dry off.

1440^CC^O^activity2^I have been spending a lot of time in my bedroom lately. My bedroom is bright, it has all sorts of colours ranging from my baby blue bedspread to yellow and orange jars to a pink dresser, but it all matches because of my wall-length poster of a hammock right infront of the beach, with many colours in the background. As I\'ve been doing my late night cramming studying for the last few days, I feel very awkward and tense until I go downstairs to my bedroom. It calms me down, reminding me that summer will come eventually, even though winter hasn\'t started yet. Sometimes, as silly as this sounds, I can imagine myself in that hammock, with the beach behind me, at my old home near Ocean City, Maryland. I think when I\'m in my bedroom, I focus on the present, because I have a little of Maryland with me in that poster. I focus on living for the day, and not dwelling on the past in Maryland or my future in Ontario. There, in my bedroom, I am halfway between both of my lives, and it makes me calm. It makes things such as school work a lot easier to handle.

1459^NR^O^activity2^As I spent time in the local park near my home I had the intention of studying and organizing my notes for upcoming assignments but as it was near a school I found myself getting distracted by all of the noise and activity coming from the playground. I thought being in the outdoors would bring me peace and solitude making it easier to gather my thoughts about my stidies but found my mind wandering to things completely unrelated to school. It was a rather warm sunny day for this time of year and I took advantage of being able to relax in this environment instead of using it to study. I also found myself in envy of the children and their carefree existance, almost jealous that they were the able to play without a care in the world which did not at all resemble my life and for a moment it made me wish I could trade places or at least be teleported back to that time in my life again. As I was thinking this is dawned on me that these were ridiculous and irrational thoughts but none the less this is what was running through my mind. I was able to get back to my studies somewhat but not in the focused direction I had planned before heading to this spot in the park. I find that what was supposed to make me feel relaxed and bring me peace only highlighted what was not possible under the circumstance of impending deadlines for assignments as well as personal commitments.

1428^CC^O^activity2^I was sitting in my living room watching TV with some friends. The screen door which was at the foot of the couch was open and a slight breeze was coming in. I was lying down on the sofa, with a pillow behind my head. I was just relaxing and watching some TV, I can\'t remember what I was watching. I was thinking to myself about all of the studying I had to do over the next week. 2 midterms in 2 days and I would be rushed for time. I had a few drinks before hand, which is one of the reasons I was so comfortable. It felt like time would go slower, which I was thankful for because I just wanted to sit there forever. If I had the choice I would be doing the same thing right now, however I must study for a midterm today and this survey itself is me procrastinating to do it.

1228^CC^O^activity2^Since I cannot go home, I picked the lounge room of my suite.  I generally feel relaxed in this room. It has comfortable couches, and I usually do work in this room. I think a lot about what work I have to accomplish when in this room. Sometimes I feel overwhlemed because it seems that I can never catch up on work.  I usually think about how I never go out, and all I do it school work! Ahh, the life of a student.   Since I spend a lot of time in this room, I usually notice when it starts to get messy or dirty. I noticed that it is relatively messy considering one of my suite-mates just cleaned it. Everyone was relatively un-impressed by her \"abilities.\"  However, when I\'m in this room, I feel less alone, because I know there are people all around me. When I\'m in my room, I feel cut off from everyone else, because they can\'t just come and talk to me. I don\'t like feeling lonely.  That is why it is hard for me to be away from my boyfriend. I think that it why I sit in the lounge, because I don\'t want to feel cut-off from everyone. They can get ahold of me if they need to.   Sometimes I find that sitting in this room however doesn\'t let me concentrate on my work as much as I should be. Its mainly because there are so many distractions from roommates and suite-mates and what not. When I know I have to get work done fast I will go work in my room. I don\'t like to do that very often. I just like working in this room. Some people don\'t really understand why I\'m always out in the lounge, but I just say, \"I like it out here!\" Also, from working out here it is easy to get distracted because other people may come and watching a movie, or play video games, which would distract anyone from homework!  The other thing I notice about this room is that we have to decorate it for Christmas soon! We decorated it for Halloween, and now its another holiday coming up! It looks bare without decorations now!

My room is a place where I am always comfortable and never looking for something to do. I am either sleeping, relaxing, cleaning, or looking through old things and reflecting on passed memories. I really like taking time to organize my room, and like to keep it tidy. I guess in a way when im keeping my room clean it helps me clear my head without reflecting on the fogging thoughts. MY room is one of the only places that I can call my own where I can choose not to share it with anyone. Everything that i cherish is kept there, and all have their own significant importance. My room is the one place someone could go if they needed to gain a better understanding of what kind of person I am.

1471^NR^O^activity2^I went for a walk to a swing set. I went swinging. It was a great stress reliever. Swinging is one of the only places you can go to where you can be in control yet out of control at the same time. It is a very neat feeling you. You can control how high you want to go but sometimes you lose it and just keep goin ghigher until you hit the spot where you lose gravity and flop back onto the swing. It is very relaxing. It is also one of the things that makes you realize why it is so great to be a kid. Little kids can go on the swings and swing for hours and not worry about what they look like or how ridiculous they are being. Adults that go on swings by themselves look weird. People judge you. But when i swing I can\'t think about that. All i think about is what is wrong and what i can do to fix it. And if i can\'t fix it then i say oh well it doesn\'t matter because you are swinging and you don\'t have to think about anything else. it just relaxes you and it doesn\'t matter about anything else. You are swinging so high and so fast that no one can catch you and make you think about reality. None of it matters. It just feels good. even if it is cold outside or raining or anything. It doesn\'t matter because its clarity.

I noticed the way the grass was finally starting to accept the change in season and lose its green colour. I noticed how awful and barren everything looks without summer or fall colours. I couldn\'t help but think about how much life has changed in the past few months and if everything is cyclical like the seasons or if these changes that have occured are permanent. It wasn\'t a very long walk but I passed by people young and old and it made me realize how accepting nature is. A path in a park is suitable for people of all ages of all backgrounds. Nature does not judge you but just is. Being outside is calming and peaceful.

It was depressingly dark out despite how early it was and there was a crooked frame on the wall across from me.  I sat there bored for a few more minutes, thinking about what to have for dinner, and then finally went over to straighten the frame since it was starting to annoy me.  I then sat down again and thought about which of the watches I had gone to see earlier that day I should buy and eventually returned to how I should do my project due tuesday.  Then my friend turned off the lights and we left.

1493^NR^O^activity2^This special place of mine is located in Parry Sound, Ontario. Its a marina on Georgian Bay, and it is by far the most beautiful, relaxing place in the area. It has a balcony with a picnic bench where not many people go. It overlooks the entire north channel, almost like a painting. This would be the best place you could ever imagine to watch a sunset or sunrise.   Coming here leaves me with complete solitude and fill me with great joy. There is no other place that calms me and rids me of my nerves like this place does. The breeze coming off the bay wisps through my hair, taking my unhappiness and sorrows with it as it leaves.   This one place is very special to me and relaxes me like no other. This is my haven, my home.

1433^NR^O^activity2^walking along the ottawa river parkway. I live very close to the parkway and walk my dog along there everyday.  It is an amazing view along pathway to westboro beach.  The trees are old and huge, the grass is cut short, the view of the river is spectacular, even in fall. It is very peaceful walk along the parkway as well. Here I notice life, ie rabbits, squirrels, birds and how they interact. I try and name different birds that I see.  When I am alone walking along the river it is the most calming, relaxing place in the world. I feel at peace and at home as I walk. It makes me feel connected to the world and to nature.

1462^CC^O^activity2^well the most comfortable indoor room i would say is my bedroom. my bedroom is where i can spend time and think about the experiences that happened through out the day. i can really do anything i want to in my room. my room is really small perfect for a student such as myself. it pretty messy not really messy. it has a ballin\' sound system in it, i use it for doing school work, you know put on some classics while doing school work, lets loose some stress. when im getting ready to go, i usually put on some trance or some hip hop to get me in the mood for parting, etc. my room is really dark at night which is perfect for sleeping except for when the sun rises, i just moved in to a new apartment and i dont have proper curtains yet so it really bright in the morning when i first moved here, ive gotten used it now. when i have friends over and there is a particular person i want have alone time with, i just bring her to my room we talk, vibe a bit and i would say that my room gives off a special aura that i would say is essential for a young man living on his own going to school meeting new people ;)

1180^CC^O^activity2^As I was sitting on my bed, I felt a deep feeling of relaxation. The longer I laid there, the more I reflected on the past week events. What also came to mind was how much I had to do for school. Though this was a silent time for me, my thoughts were yelling at me to keep pushing myself to do homework. I noticed that my room had felt more calm because of the colour I had painted it which was beige. My room was a place where  coul call it my own, and a place I could be myself without anyone critisizing me. At the same time my room can depress me because of its lack of tidyness.

1488^CC^O^activity2^I feel at peace. I thought about what I wanted to do today, tomorrow, forever. I looked around at all of the pictures I have up, I thought about my family. I thought about home. I thought about my friends. I thought about how happy that I am here.   I thought about what I used to want, before I came to university - my old passions.  I missed the volleyball court, the competitive edge to my life.  I missed writing for the love of writing.  I used to love writing.  I would write stories for fun.  I\'d write poetry and songs.  I\'d write in a journal.  I lost track of all that stuff when university started, which doesn\'t really make that much sense now that I think about it.  University should have just strengthened my ties to these things.    I started to write a story yesterday.  The beginning of a novel I guess you could say... and I haven\'t felt this much like myself in a long time.  It\'s like I have something to look forward to again.   I love my room here.  It\'s filled with so many touches that I\'ve added over the years.  I can see little pieces my roommates have added to it.   I love my roommates! I can hear them right now all going about their own business - our walls are paper thin. But it doesn\'t matter, because we know all there is to know about eachother anyways. They\'re my Ottawa family.   Never to replace my home family though.  My room is SO clean right now, which I didn\'t used to think really affected my life... but my head is so much clearer when I\'m in here now.  Probably because I want to be in here.  And I can actually see every little part of it as opposed to clothes everywhere.   Anyways, my room calms me down. Relaxes me. It\'s pretty neutral in colour, but there are bright accents everywhere.  For example when I want to just think, like right now, I sit in my hot pink bean bag chair.  And when I\'m doing school work, i sit at my white desk, with bright collages all over it.   I feel happy in here.  It\'s my favourite home away from home.

1475^NR^O^activity2^I was walking to the bus yesterday morning. I was running a bit late, but I crossed the street as usual, and was thinking about this assignment, wondering where I usually relaxed. I found that I took a moment as I was walking to admire the shade that the leaves had turned on the trees and bushes next to the hill leading up to the overpass of the Transitway, and I felt that, despite all the worries I had at that time, my mind was clear to appreciate that I was moving forward in a positive way - perhaps not the way that I had thought I would a year ago, but I was proud that I was trying to do better in school than I really ever have, that I had made an important personal decision that I may never have thought of before and that I was sticking to my guns about it, and that I had really done the right thing for myself.

1453^NR^O^activity2^I chose to spend some time outside sitting by the river, near the o-train tracks at school. The weather was a bit nippy but not enough for me to be uncomfortable. I lay back using my bag as a pillow and closed my eyes, listening to the sound of the water flowing. I thought about a lot of things. One of my pets had just recently passed away so I felt sad thinking about her. Thinking about her made me think about other not too pleasant things including my aunt who was diagnosed with cancer last year. I thought about life and where I want to go with it. I thought about how unsatisfied with my grades I am and how I allowed myself to slip so far bahind. I wondered why I\'ve been feeling so down. I wondered why I feel like screaming at the top of my lungs just to vent frustrations and why I haven\'t done so yet. I wondered why I care what other people think about me. I wondered what I could do to fix things. I gave a lot of thought to see a councellor, but reasoned with myself that I\'m not good at approaching other people with my problems. Mostly I just found myself missing bunny and wishing I could have at least been there for her when she passed...I don\'t like thinking that she died alone.

1502^CC^O^activity2^In my bedroom I experienced many happy/intense emotions from listening and playing music.  The main things I noticed was the work I was doing, the computer and emails and the music. I experienced thoughts of anxiety in having too much to get done and alertness from drinking coffee, but also mental fatigue from constant work and focus the last few days.  At times I felt content and enthusiastic/motivated about what I was doing but other times I get frustrated or lose focus and experience a fight with negative emotions from not wanting to work.  I experienced some boredom in the studying I was trying to finish. Lots of joy came from listening to good music as well as creating music and talking to others who came into the bedroom.

1500^CC^O^activity2^I recently spent a good 4-5 hours  making this bike for my little brother. I pretty much took apart my broken old bike and his old bike and made it so the front wheel is bigger than the back. I was very relaxed while making it, wasn\'t in a rush (its still not completely finished). i didn\'t really notice what was going on around me. it was cool though, had both garage doors open. a lot of space too since the cars were both gone. overall it was just a neat little experiment that let me escape from school work and stress.

I was watching mainly simpsons and late night shows. I mainly noticed the tv in my room and my music player because during commercials I would play some tunes. That day i mainly felt depressed and upset and not the least bit happy. Whenever I am on my bed im either watching tv and music to forget about school and work for a moment in order to change my attitude. I would grab a snack every hour or so. There wasnt much thinking involved because i tried to drown out my thoughts from my test through tv and music.

I tried to relax while thinking of ideas for my next studio project (a night table that we had to design and construct). I thought about how bright the colours in my room were in comparison to the gloomy outdoors. I thoguht sobut the people that spend time in this room, and how they have contributed to my transition from high school to university life. I felt a bit calmer but it was hard to shake the feeling of upcoming projects from my mind. I\'ve accepted it as a reality- my design work will always be in mind, even after university. The best I can do is hope that I can transform my design development into part of my relaxation (something that I was trying to do in this exercise).

1492^CC^O^activity2^i spent time in my living room, on the comfy couch that i own. i was warm under the blankets, and i focused on the window overlooking the outdoors. it was raining heavily, but i didn\'t mind because the sound of raindrops hitting the roof always relaxes me. i noticed how cloudy it was outside, and was relieved to be lying on my warm couch. i was also glad to be in the presence my boy friend, whom i hadn\'t seen all week. together we laid there with nothing important to say, or do. we just enjoyed each others company and dozed in and out of sleep. i was so happy to be on that couch doing nothing, and wished that day could have lasted forever. i felt like i didn\'t have enough time to just sit and do nothing. it was good to just have silence for a while as opposed to the hustle bustle of a hallway at school, or a lecture, or the bus. my mind was able to shut down for a while. and i focused on the rhythm of my breathing. i learned to do that from a yoga class that i had taken, and have found that breathing helps me relax a lot. instead of letting my mind race, with thoughts of exams, and papers, and appointments i need to make, all i had to concentrate on was slowing my breathing rate. this helped be fall asleep quickly, with the sound of the rain, the warmth of the couch, my boyfriend near by. i was so content to be there, and felt that in those moments everything was perfect. i realized that i should probably take more time to relax like i did that day, but that it probably wouldn\'t happen, seeing as most of my time is spent doing readings and such. this made me feel a little disappointed, but at the same time, i was appreciative that i had those moments.

1501^NR^O^activity2^I went to the local park and sat on the swings just thinking about things. I began to remember the different things that had happened there through out my time in that neighbourhood. I remember when my friends and I were filming a horror film for our class project and it was freezing cold that day so we decided to film another day. It was winter and it was pretty cold at that moment as well so I felt like I could sort of see everything as it happened. I remember meeting friends at the park after school from grade 5-8. One of my friends and I always got into fights but they were never serious. I felt nostalgia I guess just remembering all sorts of things there. I remember riding down the hill on my bike that is right across from the swing set. I guess I was too busy remembering things to take notice to smaller details. I sort of felt sad remembering the past as for some reason it always gets to me and I wish I could go back to change things or just go back and stay in the past. The park was empty but there were people walking along the side of the park every once in a while. But I felt pretty lonely. The sky was cloudy and the trees were blowing really lightly in the wind. I like the feeling of wind in my hair, it is relaxing. I didn\'t swing high on the swing I more just shifted side to side and back and forth. It was actually really nice to do something like that. It took my mind off things. I also noticed how some things had changed, some due to passing years and some things changed because of teh seasons. I remember walking along the park path many times through the years with friends, not always the same ones and sometimes all of them together. We would just talk sometimes about drama that was current in our circle of friends and it seemed so important then. I wish that insiginificant stuff was the stuff that was still so important. I had my first cigarette just down the path. I didn\'t care for it much, but it was an experience. I guess I am glad that I am not addicted to them. They aren\'t very good. One of my friends kissed me while I was on the swing that I was currently sitting on. We had a whole weird experience though, I mean our friendship was always different, it is a really long story, but I won\'t forget that because she really really liked me but I just didn\'t feel the same way. She is sort of weird now. I don\'t get to talk to her a whole lot but the memories made me miss her because she has changed and isn\'t as ignorant as she used to be. I also started thinking about different scenes I could film for upcoming movies in the park. I have a really cool idea for a film and I am filming it with friends, some of the same ones from the last one, this coming summer break. I want to make this next one gory though just sort of to show off my talent I guess. Some of the trees still have leaves but winter is fast upon us so most of the green comes from the pine trees. It was nice to go back. Maybe I\'ll do it more often now. I would like to go on wlaks with friends again eventually.

There have been many parties back there, many moments with friends, breakups, laughter, alone time and family time. The last time I was there I was sitting on the deck by myself and it was peaceful. I can always think clearly when I am at their house.THe surroundings are familiar and it feels safe. There is no deadlines or worries...just the backyard, the comfort, the breeze, my parents inside, and my thoughts. If there are any stresses in my life they were not present in the backyard.

I remember looking around the room and seeing the pink walls and detesting them (this is my sisters old room) I felt very happy to be talking to my boy friend while stroking his hair. He makes me feel confident and happy. I was sad also because I remember telling him that I would not be able to see him for about a month. I almost felt like crying feeling him press himself into me giving me a great big hug. Though I was sad I knew I\'d see him again soon we said that we loved each other and everything seemed to be better in that moment.

1220^CC^O^activity2^I was in my bedroom at home and I felt very comfortable. It\'s a familiar place that made me feel happy. I noticed my dog in there with me. He was being very friendly and I felt happy to be with him. I was on my computer listening to music which put me in a good mood. My friends were chatting with me online about the previous night which brought back pleasant memories. I was in a good place.

1358^CC^O^activity2^I sat on the comfy couch in the living room. I thought about roomate issues, my mom coming to visit, christmas, exams, work. I felt excited when thinking about my mom visiting, and for christmas. Felt very nervous about the roomate issues, and was wondering how to resolve them. I thought about exams and how on earth I\'m going to prepare for them, which of course got me a little stressed out. I spend a lot of time thinking about the issue with one of my roomates, trying to convince myself to get over it, and move on, even though I know that I can\'t. The roomate problem really bothers me, makes me really happy, but also really sad at the same time. Jealous. He makes me very confused. Didn\'t really notice anything in particular about the room, except that it needed to be tidied. I\'ve has this living room for 2.5 years now, so I don\'t spend much time looking at it specifically.

1476^CC^O^activity2^This morning I spent an hour and a half in the kitchen washing dishes, cleaning, and eating breakfast. I love being up before the sun comes up and before anyone else is up.  I actually hate, unless I\'ve gotten lots of sleep, for anyone to talk to me, to turn on any lights, or to make lots of noise. I spent the first hour cleaning the counters and the stove and washing all of the dishes from last night\'s dinner. There were lots of crumbs from the baking that my youngest sisters did last night and pieces of parsley leaves from dinner. I put away whatever was in the draining rack, and put away the food still on the stove from last night, and washed everything up. The dishes weren\'t very dirty.  Some of them had chocolate icing on them and the only other food on the dirty dishes was parsley and a bowl full of cabbage that I threw away. I tried not to make too much noise, because I didn\'t want anyone to wake up and I also hate lots of noise in the morning.  I kept checking the clock while I was doing the dishes in the dark and was surprised the first time to realize that I\'d only been at the sink for 20 minutes. I also had to dry some of the dishes I washed at the beginning to make room in the dish rack for the rest. I thought that I would also clean the microwave from last week\'s escargot, but I did not think that I had enough time. After all of the dishes were done, I spent about 20 minutes preparing and eating breakfast. I had a bowl of cereal with a cut-up banana, then half an apple and the rest of the banana, and a glass of juice.  I thought that it was a small breakfast, but I knew that I had lots of food left over from yesterday that I could bring for a snack and lunch tomorrow. When I finished, I washed the dishes I used and went to get ready.    In terms of details, I noticed the cut in the vinyl kitchen floor that has been there for months and is slowly getting worse. I also love how the light from outside was blue and cold. I like waking up in the twilight because I am alone and don\'t have to deal with annoyances in the morning. I don\'t like noise or light in the morning, so I had a light in another room on (so no direct light) when I first woke up, since it was too dark to see without. After it brightened up a little outside, I turned it off. I used cold water for the most part when washing the dishes. I don\'t like to feel too warm in the morning, or at any time... It\'s uncomfortable. I only like to sweat when I\'m playing sports or working out.    I thought mainly about my day, planned it out, what I would do and when. Thought about going to the gym this morning, but decided not to when I considered that I would be too tired by the end of the day: I have class all day, then have to work overnight  tonight.  I also have a full morning of appointments tomorrow. I thought about cancelling my first appointment tomorrow, since I want to be clear-headed when I am there... and I will appreciate the extra sleep tonight. I thought also about how I said yesterday that I would be on time for my first class today and, seeing how early I was up, I felt that there was no way that I would be late.    Right now, I have been thinking about writing this passage. This is the second time that I am writing it (there was some sort of error the first time). I feel like getting it over with... I hate spending too much time on a computer and staring at the screen dries out my eyes. I have also been thinking a lot about a girl in my Portuguese class and wondering if I could take her out. I wonder if she has a boyfriend? But I am also glad that I have finished typing this and

1490^CC^O^activity2^I chose my residence room...  I spend much of my time in my room doing homework or on my computer. It is a nice place to go to when I need to relax or get away for a while.   I usually just think about how much work I have to do or about my family back home. I don\'t get much alone time because I have a roommate and i find it difficult sometimes to fully relax and think about things. My bed is the place where I think the most because it is really comfortable and cozy..recently I have been thinking about the summer and if I am going to stay in Ottawa or move back to the Toronto area.

1272^CC^O^activity2^I was watching football with my friends on sunday afternoon. We were enjoying a great game at my friends house with food and drinks. It was very relaxing. I felt sevral different emotions while i was watching the game. I felt anxious when my team was about to score and i felt very exicted and spirited when they actually did score. I felt kind scared when the opposing team was about to score and felt very disappointed when my team lost the game. I also felt a bit irritated when im girlfriend constantly called every 1/2 hour because it was interfering wid my enjoyment of the game. I felt like i belonged there wit my friends to when we watch the football game. It is a good time to relax and have fun with all my friends.

1441^NR^O^activity2^I went to a Christmas parade in Toronto this past weekend with my girlfriend.  we had a blast all weekend, I only get to see her avg. twice a month and truly cherish the weekends we spend together.  no matter what were doing its amazing and im in awe of her and our relationship is strong.  i enjoyed being outside with her at the parade, although i would have enjoyed anything we did as long as were spending time together.  She goes to school there, i go to school here part time and work full time.  i pretty much dread my job and cant wait to move there.sunday nights i begin dreading my job again, and also on  weekends we visit each other it also means were departing each other as well sooo, double wammy. as far as being outside with her it was truly great.  that is when i am truly happiest is with her,i feel like myself again.  at work i can feel like someone else and out of touch with myself.  for the most part the guys I work with are awesome hardworking guys. (underground construciton) but as you can tell if your still reading this, i dont exactly love my job but am doing to save money for school and to move to T.O. to live together.    the parade was alotta fun, great way to spend the aft., get a coffee and desrtact ourselves from the upcoming week, and me dreading the drive home.  but i dont think of it at all while there, or after either while we go browsing at bookstores or electronic stores or while out to lunch.  cant wait till our situation and lives meet up once again and were living together again.  so i guess to sum it up i want to be with her, working away at school (her too) and i dont love my job, but being out at that parade was surprisingly alotta fun.

1429^NR^O^activity2^I went for a walk late at night off campus. It was dark, and misting rain, but I didn\'t mind because I just wanted to walk. It made me sad to be outside going for a walk because I know I am only going for a walk because I can\'t run anymore because of an injury. I really wanted to go for a run and release some stress and listen to music, but walking is as good as I can do now. It also gave me time to be alone and outside of my room. I wasn\'t afraid because it was late out, or that I was alone, I was comfortable. It doesn\'t really have an  effect on me that I\'m a girl walking by myself late at night, my friends always get mad at me for that if I tell them that that is what I\'m doing. So normally I don\'t answer their calls or texts asking \"What\'s up?\"   I really like being outside by the canal too, it makes me a little nostalgic because I am from the East Coast and miss the water. So I love hanging out by the canal. I noticed that I was puddle jumping at one point, unintentionally, I just didn\'t want to get my shoes wet, but after a while I gave up, who cares about water, it evaporates, stuff dries.  I didn\'t notice much about nature than I would normally notice, everything was just wet this time from the rain. It was pretty-

1495^NR^O^activity2^i am sitting on sand on  a beach wathcing the sunset. Birds are flying above me and they are cawing, it is very peacful and quite. You hear voices but the sounds are very far and distant. I hear people laughing and they seem to be into what they are doing. I am thinking of my life in general and that person that i have become. I am still not satisfied with everything and i regret many decisions that i had done and i constantly wish to go back and change my mistakes. I look around and envy the people around me and I sometimes wish to have what they have. I do not feel as though i am depressed but as though something is missing. I constantly think and hope that someone will come and tap me on my shoulder and give/ fulfill that missing piece in my heart. I wish i can draw the sunset, the beautiful colours that the sun is creating as it is coming down. The soft yellows mixed with a splash of orange and red. I envy the sun for being able to hid and reapeare. I am watching the water being pushed by the air, as the soft breeze is creating cracks and lines on top of the water. I envy the cleanliness and the tranquility of this moment. I wish to take it with me. I am enjoying this moment even though I am thinking of the many stresses of my life, but at this moment I am not dealing with them.I am calm and relaxed I am in a state of hope actually. I want to be better, I want to achieve everything that i only dream for. But I know it will remain un reachable and will stay far away from me. I hope that one day I will be able to become a better person and be able to be true to myself and others. As I am thinking this I am watching the view around me, the trees creating moving from side to side. Completely full of life and bursting with leaves. They are plump and full they are creating soft music. Wooshes almost precisley it is nice to hear this, the closest thing to music and it is coming from nature. I am not sure if I am sad or happy. I am not sure if am satisfied or maybe my life if good, just when I look around. I look around and I see people with things that I want. I envy their power, their material posessions I envy them and I think what their lives are behind closed doors. Is it better than mine? Does everyone have a story like mine? These are the many questions that I think about when I am alone. I try to avoid saddness but I see people and their happiness and i feel alone inside. I feel isolated and unloved. Are these people genuwinely loved? Am I loved this way as I see people holding and kissing the forheads of their beloved. I envy those people, but I also wonder is it fake and do I really have it better off? The sun is still setting and it is still tranquil. It is a nice day; beautiful in fact. I wish it is like this many days.

Because I have work and go to school, I never seem to have time for myself anymore, and so this time of relaxation is very important and rewarding for me. I feel very content and at ease, wishing I could spend hours in bed just relaxing and resting. When I wake up, I am still feeling relaxed and it is a peaceful time. I notice that I can hear the clock ticking, and begin to look around my room. I see all of my pictures, drawings and photographs from my childhood, and remember all the good memories in my lifetime. I wish this moment could go on forever.    Right now, as I am writing this, I honestly can not wait to do just this- go to my room, pull out a book to read, relax, and take a well deserved nap. Although I have essays and midterms to worry about, this discription that I have written down has caused me to forget about all of that, and to ease my stress.

It was very beautiful during the fall, the water and trees especially were very bright and vibrant.  I also think about what\'s going on in my life.      I\'m not from Ottawa, and I generally think about home when I\'m on the bridge.  I don\'t know if I compare what I\'m seeing to home, or I recognize something that might be similar.  I just do when I\'m walking across it.      I don\'t know what I like about the bridge, I don\'t think it is really attractive.  Its just plain and really simple.  I\'m a Industrial Design student and I generally pay attention to things like these.

I was thinking about my situation recently and feeling depressed about my thoughts, feelings, and actions recently. I reminded myself that nothing else matter but my relationship with Jesus Christ and started to feel better. Reminding myself that its not about me and that Jesus Christ is there to help me and has a plan for my life changed my attitude. In reminding myself that he promised never to leave me or forsake me, I felt better about myself and and my chances of changing the negative aspects of myself with his help.

This is the room which holds all my entertaiment items, the things I\'ve purchased over the years that were designed to entertain and be enjoyed. So it seems natural that I would enjoy spending time here. It is were I can unwind after working and going to school. It is also the place I can work on my hobbies. The elements in the room I tend to notice and pay attention to are the items i\'m generally interacting with. I suppose the decorations I\'ve hung on the walls and the aquarium add to the overall atmostphere making the room feel warm and comfortable. I also have a small fridge so cold beverages are never far away. The majority of my time i spend at the house is in this room and I do a number of activities that don\'t always feel are enjoyable or at least i\'m not in the mood to do, but I think having a comfortable place to do them in makes it a little more bearable.

1477^NR^O^activity2^There is a park in my home town called Centeen park. It is a place where ships stop occasionally to spend the night, but usually during the summer months, it is a place where teenagers go to jump into the river. It isn\'t very high, only 10 feet or so, but the feeling that you get when you leap in and feel your feet first break the water, then eventually your head go under, is almost like everything you have been worrying about just goes away. Everything you were thinking about before you go under disappears when you can no longer hear or see or smell the world above you. It is just you and the water. The only thought when you are under water is whether to swim forward or swim up.  Depending on the size of the breath you took before you hit, sometimes you need to come back to the world immediately. But if your breath was big enough, you can keep swimming, you can stay under water until your lungs hurt. The longer you stay under the better it feels when you come up.  It is a different take on refreshing. It isn\'t that it is cold-refreshing, but mind-refreshing. It feels good to stop thinking, to stop worrying, about the things above the water. Its a relief. Almost like the relief of the weight you carry around all the time, and then when you are in water, you feel light as a feather.

I thought of the memories i\'ve experienced with the furniture, for example, all of the family dinners at the dining room table, or cuddling on the couch with my boyfriend. I feel at peace with my surroundings, the light coloured walls, and layout of the furniture make it an open, light space. Reflecting now, I think of the fact that I feared not feeling at home here (as I recently moved out of my parents home on my own), but am very happy that I adapted so easily to the environment and made it my own. The feelings of comfort, relaxation, and thankfulness would be the primary feelings that I experienced.

1338^CC^O^activity2^My bedroom is the place I think of as for my comfortable indoor place. I come to my room to go on the computer to try to get away from the worries of school and home problems, so I can jsut talk to friends over the internet or watch TV. Whenever I\'m in my room I feel safe because I know where I am and I can do what I want without being bothered. I don\'t suaully have too many deep feelings or thoughts while I\'m in my room because I try and get away from all the thinking and worries, but when I really need to think about school work I can go to my room for silence. It helps me to understand things better if I can go over them in my head while by myself and my room is a very good place to do this.

1118^CC^O^activity2^Recently, I chose to spend time in my bed. This is very comfortable for me because it is where I can completely be myself and am not vulnerable to the outside world. I chose this place because I find myself very comfortable and reflective whenever I am there, and during times of stress I imagine being there. My bed is right by a window so while I am there I can look out my window and reflect on my life. I usually feel pretty content there and when I wake up there from a good nights sleep, sometimes I forget the things that were bothering me so much the day before, in fact, I even feel confident and not insecure about them. So as I am writing this I am thinking that mabye there are some people in my life who are preventing me from being the person that I really am by making me insecure... and that I need to move on and be myself even know I will be vulnerable for the time being. Because that will be like a place that I am truly content and myself: my bed! The aspects of my room that I most notice is white light in the morning as the walls in my room are white and so are my bed sheets. I notice so many things in my room that I never use and I wonder why I even bother having them around. If I got rid of all of it my room would be pretty empty and minimalist. My deepest feelings and thoughts are that I can wake up one day and achieve everything that I want to... but I feel like I am not confident enough to do this yet and I need to learn that this will not spur from some event but it will be a process.

1496^CC^O^activity2^I chose to spend time in my living room during the previous exercise.  This is a room that I often spend time in with my two roommates relaxing and conversing.  After long days spent studying, working on assignments, or going to class it is normally where we all retreat to unwind before night.  I remembered that I was to pay special attention to my thoughts and my environment, and I became directly aware of my reactions to objects in the room or things said by my companions.  I realized that when there are an overwhelming amount of stimuli in the environment, I also feel overwhelmed.  I recognized this by an instinctual reaction I had to a sweater on the floor, and thought about how when the room is extremely messy, my attention and reaction is multiplied.  I also recall becoming aware of the process of conversation I sometimes do not afford my full attention to the speaker as I\'m thinking about the things I will say in response.  I remember thinking further that this was a bad habit because if one does afford full attention the speaker has time to articulate their point thoroughly, and the listener will have a chance to articulate a response that conveys their feelings or thoughts.  This exercise brought to my attention how often I may be in an environment and not consciously register a lot of incoming signals and take them for granted.  Afterwards I felt that focussing my attention to details in my surroundings made me feel somewhat more calm and centered or \'at peace\'.  I was more silent and involved with my thoughts afterwards.

And not just design, but design anything i want, the world is my oyster.

I felt my bedroom enclose me into a world that no one could enter. It was just me, no other.

1499^NR^O^activity2^recently i was outside carlteon university by the river. i always look at the water flowing when i pass by on the train but i never think to go there when i have free time. finally i rememebered it when i had time to myself two days ago. i went and took a few of my friends along with me. it was too cold to bring a picnic but we had our camera so we just sat and acted like goofs, taking a million pictures of the same poses over and over again. we would look at the picture and laugh over small details about how our mouths looked or how we looked disformed in the photo. we were there for an hour and a half doing nothing but laughing, taking pictures, and laughing even more. at times it was hard to breathe. now i am almost about to burst out laughing but i will try to retain myself since there are many people around. i always love to have these friends around me because we always end up in these laughing and giggling fits. its a very rare occurance for us to not be happy around each other. i love them because they are serious when i need them to be, but most of the time we laugh. finally when i got a hold of the camera, i wanted to take more photographic and artistic photos rather than just our four faces squeezed into this small frame. i had them pose in groups and alone, using nature as a backdrop, and giving the photo a more natural look. my friend took the camera from me and told me to look at the river  she stood back and took a picture of me looking into the water. when i looked at it i realized how serene and content i was. all it took was that photo to make me realize that i was a really lucky person.

I had ended a relationship right before moving to Ottawa, and everything at home reminded me of it.

1126^CC^O^activity2^i was sitting on my bed reading my psychology textbook and planning what i was going to do for my birthday dinner. i was talking to one of my friends on facebook, and we decided that we would go out to a restaurant. i discussed this with several of my other friends. we could not make reservations, so we agreed that we would just go earlier to make sure that we got a seat. when my other friends were getting ready, my close friend and i were doing work, so we asked if they could wait about 15 minutes to go. they said no, and that it would be impossible to get seats if we waited. so two of them left, and one of my friends was left standing in the doorway. we hadn\'t really gotten along in about 3 weeks, and she was really starting to annoy me, saying that we had to leave now and couldn\'t wait for anyone. when i told her that they could go and my other friend and i would meet them there, she used profanity against me, and stomped out of my room slamming the door behind her. she turned to my friends that were waiting in the hall and said that there was no way in hell she was going to supper with me. i felt so angry that i just wanted to punch something, so i went into my friend\'s room and although she was doing work, she took the time to actually listen to how i felt, and we shared our experiences with each other about the other friends. my close friend and i then decided that the two of us, along with my roommate would go out for supper still, and we would have a great time. our residence fellow then came into the room because he had heard the profanity and asked if everything was okay. he sat down in the really big, heavy red chair and so i explained the situation, and he told me not to worry about it, and that it was my birthday so i should be out having fun. i went onto the internet to email my mom and brother and tell them what my plans were, as they were inquiring how i was going to celebrate, and just as i was getting ready to finish the email and send it, my phone rang. i answered it, and it was my mother. she told me that my aunt had passed away. i was really close with my aunt, so i felt like a million bullets went right through me. i had told my friend and res fellow this, and they sat with me through the whole thing. i explained stories of my aunt and me, and they comforted me; just like i knew my brother would have done. we decided that we would still go out for supper, but we would go later when i was feeling a little better. the \"friend\" that had used profanity came back into my room a little while later, without knocking or anything. just walked in and said that they were now going to the cafeteria and we were welcome to go get food with them if we liked. i asked her how i could possibly act like she had not said those things, and how i could just go about acting normal, when i knew that an apology was in order. i told her i had no intention of going to the caf with her or the others, and she once again slammed the door. i really felt like opening the door and yelling, but then i realized that everyone in the hall would then become involved, and no good would come of it. so i decided to go out to supper and have a great birthday with the many friends that don\'t treat others like crap, and respect them. the ones that asked how my day was and were really excited to see me and ask me what i wanted to do on my birthday; not ones that told me what to do, acting like my parents, and telling me when i can and can\'t do things, and ones that swear at me because they don\'t get their way. i feel like everything that i wanted to escape from in high school: the drama, the girls fighting over stupid things, and the reasons for killing each other, i just couldn\'t escape. it all came here, and it doesn\'t help anyone out. it stresses people out so much that they can\'t handle other things going on in their lives. i still can\'t bring myself to forgive her, and most of it is because she acts like she did nothing wrong. she tries to act like it never happened, and i\'m not okay with that. i would like her to apologize, but then again, \"you can\'t always get what you want\". we are growing further apart, and surprisingly, it doesn\'t bother as much as i actually thought it would because i have other friends that actually care about how i feel. other friends that notice when something about you changes, or can tell when you\'re feeling really sad or upset. friends that know when you\'re having a bad day, and know when to talk to you and when to just let you calm down. since that incident, only one of the three girls has come to apologize, and i thank her very much. i have forgiven her, and can move on with that, but with the other two girls, i just can\'t seem to let it go. how can you just forget about all the bad things that someone has done to you; especially if they aren\'t that sorry for them? i\'m okay with having a few really close friends, rather than having a million acquaintances. it\'s better for everyone, and as for the stress and anger; well it\'s still there, but i try not to let it show too much on the people that have done nothing to me to deserve getting anger thrust upon them. i keep trying to replay that night in my head, wondering how else it might have turned out, but i guess it turned out for the better, because i can really tell who my true friends are now. they\'re the ones who take responsibility for their actions, and who care about you. they\'re the ones who\'ll stick by your side through anything, and for that i am truly grateful. as for the friend the cursed me, i\'m still angry, but i\'m trying not to let everything hang on those moments; i\'m trying to move on.

1521^NR^O^activity2^I thought it was weird at first, sitting outside. I sat on a bench outside of residence, one that I often look down upon from my bedroom window. I felt weird but I don\'t think anyone else thought it was weird that I was just sitting there. I thought about people, watched people, what they were wearing. I though about what I was going to do that evening, and gradually I shifted into thinking about the next couple months, and then years. I tried to be very aware of nature, I tried to listen to things. I heard the wind, footsteps, talking. I felt the cold air on my cheeks. I tried to think deeply but then I thought about why I was doing this, and what it had to do with the study. Then I wondered how many people are actually going to do it. I tried to think \"deeply\" but I wasn\'t quite sure what that meant, so I contemplated the meaning of life. But then I realized I didn\'t know, it was hard to be deep. I felt a little strange just sitting, I felt nice though, just sitting for a while and watching and listening. It was nice to have fresh air and nothing to do momentarily.

1528^CC^O^activity2^I enjoyed looking out side to see the piles of snow while it continued to snow for hours I end. The fireplace was lit it was warm in the room. I was in my comfortable chair with laptop on my lap just relaxing occasionally glancing at the television. The room felt very comfortable with the christmas decorations everywhere. I had a long day studying but I was now relaxed and enjoying the rest of the evening. It was very cold outside, but inside I was happy and warm.

1511^NR^O^activity2^I went out to the park today and I was walking in between imprinted foot steps and I thought about all the people that had walked through here today. The park entrance way had a closed sign on it that I had to climb over. I was sitting on a black cold bench, and I was smoking. It was cold, and the sun was setting, the birds stopped singing. I could hear the rustling of the trees, as the wind became stronger. There was a few trees around me, their limbs were long and strangled.

1531^NR^O^activity2^I was recently just walking the dog, which I rarely do. It was a nice cool day and very sunny. I suddenly realized how peaceful the city is. Although there is so much snow and it gets dark fast, it felt very nice to see life going on around. I watched kids building snow forts and snowmen. They were laughing at the silliest and simplest things, and I thought - life can be relaxing and simple. If I made time for it. Everywhere, people were with their families or friends, either in their houses having a nice family day or kids going to the corner store to buy some chocolate bars - it was just so simple. I have almost forgotten about taking my time to relax and just do things I like. The Outdoor fresh air, plus the sun shining, refreshed my mind and my mood towards life. It was a very nice moment.

1425^NR^O^activity2^I am sitting on my balcony outside having a coffee in the morning. It is somewhat mild out, and snow is falling slowly. The coffee is warm, and its quiet outside. The coffee and the atmosphere reminds me of being back home in northern ontario. I feel at ease, i think about all the fun times ive had back home with my friends and family. I miss them. The snow also reminds me of the christmas holidays, going to cottages and ice fishing. I feel happy while i remember all the good times at home. I then begin to feel excited about the upcomming christmas holiday, I miss my family so much. I also feel that its nice to sit and remember good times back home.

1116^NR^X^activity2^An outdoor place I can think of is being by the canal at Carleton studying for exams last year. The atmosphere of being in a cool breeze and studying was quite relaxing. It took the pressure off compared to sitting in a quiet library -- a very anxious setting. Instead we threw around a frisbee during study breaks to calm the mood. Moreover, it was very relaxing and we achieved a lot of studying while enjoying it at the same time.

1130^NR^X^activity2^I was walking my boyfriends fathers dog wiht my boyfriend, who I am not happy wiht.     I was enjoying the outdoors, and wishing that I could hide away in the woods from everything. I loved the park, it was cold but still beuatuful. there were no leaves but the tress were nice, and there were lots of other dogs which made me happy. I remember thiinking how scary it would be at night to be there alone. I think that I like the park becuase sometimes I wish that I was just  little animal that could go and hide in a tree and not deal with the world, but little animals need to deal with big preditor animals so maybe I would be worse off then I am.     the sounds of the park are great, they are the winds through the tress and the crunching of leaves adn the sounds of dogs running.

1538^CC^O^activity2^     I enjoy spending time in my dining room or as I refer to it..\'my office\'. This is where I do my household finances, puzzles, read the newspaper, sort through flyers, etc. This is where I think about the future and reflect on the past. It is here that decisions are made, bills are paid and where I worry most about my daughter\'s future, my son\'s present and my own state of health.      During the day, the sun shines through the window and I can see people walk by and watch the comings and goings in the parking lot. At night, the shade is drawn and the room is warmed from the kitchen. It is quiet and peaceful and even though it is open to the living room, the TV sounds are somewhat muted.

I put the leg rest up on the leather lazy-boy couch and cuddled up under the blanket with a glass of juice and some crackers to munch on. I felt comfortable and relaxed. I always feel at home in my parent\'s PMQ more so than at any apartment I have rented on my own. We watched sitcoms, it was funny and a good break from the day.

1537^NR^O^activity2^I went cross-country skiing and experienced a feeing of rejuvenation from being in the outdoors. I noticed the details of the trees and how perfect aspects of nature are when untouched by humans. For example, the snow and the marks from the wind. I felt at peace when thinking about how beautiful the forest was, even though it was rather cold outside. I paid less attention to the temperature of the air and instead concentrated more on the quiet of the forest and the joy that it brought to me. It allowed my mind to rest and feel relaxed, improving my attention, clarity of mind and reduced my anxiety and feelings of worry. The simplicity of being among animals and trees brought a sense of calm and made me more attentive to my surroundings and their details.

However, the ocean and the shore always give me great pleasure.  It is a very calming experience for me.  The tide was out but there was tremendous activity on the shore - lots of sea birds.  There were quiet times for them but also some squabbles which I find funny to watch.  I often wonder what they are thinking when they stand with the very cold water lapping around their feet.    I enjoy walking along the shore just looking for shells especially Moonsnail shells - they are usually large and finding one of them makes my day complete - today I was not lucky.    I am very very fortunate to live beside the ocean and I do take advantage of it often - it is wonderful.

I try to fight the feeling of how scared i am my husband is going to lose his job. How hard it is to raise my kids by myself why he works out of town. Im scared, i dont want to get up, i just want to lay here and relax and not worry about my responsibilities. The sun is hot i love it. The sand is so hot you can barely walk on it. I just lay here and want it to last forever...Just me being realxed and not worrying about the kids, bills, my job, my future with my  husband. Noone is calling my name wanting anything, I love it.

1547^NR^O^activity2^I was outdoors for over two hours last night at a downhill ski lesson. It was a warmish night, for winter at least, maybe -5, so it was pleasant to be outdoors in the fresh air. I was not cold and dressed comfortably. It was snowing lightly, and I noticed how pretty the falling snow looked alluminated by the lights on the hill. I thought about how I really don\'t like winter much at all, but that the snow can be pretty. I also thought about how nervous I was - I\'ve not really been skiing before, and my first ski experience was a bad one so I was afraid of falling or losing control on the hill. So while the rest of the group went to the top of the hill, I stayed at the bottom, climbing up a ways and then skiing down slowly, trying to learn how to turn and control my speed. Finally the teacher convinced me to go up in the lift - I\'m normally very afraid of hieghts, but the ride in the lift didn\'t bother me that much so I felt excited and proud that I didn\'t let my fear of heights hold me back there. But once at the top, I couldn\'t control my speed and I got very scared and forced myself to fall in order to stop hurtling down the hill. I haven\'t learned yet how to turn, and I was very frustrated with myself for not being able to get the hang of it. I tried a few more times but got stuck on a steep part after I fell, afraid to continue. I took of my skiis and walked down the rest of the hill, disappointed in myself and ashamed that I\'d failed in front of all the people in my class.

I should clarify that I was lying in bed with my lights off, so that the stars were glowing.      I relaxed physically, but mentally I kept thinking about what I had to do in the coming days (I am a bit of a worrier). I didn\'t have particularly deep thoughts, given that I didn\'t end up feeling particularly relaxed.  I did however feel that my room was larger than normal.  After the activity, I suppose I became more relaxed as I suddenly realized that I was tired.

1549^NR^O^activity2^      I like to walk around behind the Parliament Buildings. There are plenty of little paths and spots to stop and look around, over the Ottawa River to Hull and over the Parliament grounds. It\'s been really cold lately but I like to bundle up in a lot of warm clothes and walk around. There weren\'t many people around because of the cold but it\'s really nice. The cold weather makes me feel more alive, you\'ve got to keep moving to keep warm. You can see your breath, making your breathing very apparent. There have been some rather big changes in my life in the past year, so I was mostly thinking about those. Thinking about where I am right now, where I want to go and how to go about doing this. There have also been some interpersonal issues in my life that I\'ve got to try to get a handle on. I try not to dwell on things, but some good thinking time is beneficial once in awhile.           This was more of a self-reflective trip outside for me, although there were some elements of nature that I noticed. We recently went through a bit of a thaw and then more of a freeze, so the icicles had some interesting shapes and angles. I love the patterns that the snow makes from the blowing wind, I tend to notice things of that nature. It was snowing, a light blowing snow, so you couldn\'t see too far across the Ottawa River.         I didn\'t really come to any conclusions regarding my circumstances or anything but it was nice to just to go out and think about things. Walking around and enjoying the outdoors can really put things in perspective, and can make you feel like everything will work out.

People around me seems also enjoy the weather and everyone is smiling.

1567^NR^O^activity2^On the hill behind the house, looking across at the mountains - it\'s a spectacular view.    Thoughts were a bit gloomy - Mountains etc will be here long after I\'ve gone, long after all existing hassles have gone (all minor stuff - slight health issues, a house that seems to need constant expensive repairs, so that we can\'t really afford to live here, but have no chance of selling it in the current economic climate.  And so on).

1543^NR^O^activity2^At first I felt a lot of resentment for having to go out into the freezing cold. Really hate being outdoors in winter because of the cold.  It was also difficult to navigate the path I was on so my attention was on getting from A to B without falling and I didn\'t notice much else. I do remember thinking that there were birds singing which struck me as odd so late in the day. I also remember thinking of all the reasons I hate being out in nature especially the discomfort and inconvenience. Then I started feeling really vulnerable. There was no one else around and the spot was somewhat isolated and I started worrying about the fact that anything could happen to me and there\'d be no one around to help. I started thinking about the suspicious looking guys that I saw waiting in their cars at the entrance to the trail    It seemed to take forever to get to the place where I could see the Falls but when I got there it was quite spectacular. Part of the falling water had frozen in really awesome multicolored ribbons and the rest of the water was flowing strongly through a narrow chute. In my mind it justified the arduous trek but I was freezing and anxious to get back to the warmth and safety of my car so headed back. After what felt like forever I finally made it back. I thought for sure I\'d put in more than the required 15 minutes but it turned out to be less than 10.    Another kind of interesting thing I felt coming back was the thought that I really felt alive and this time survived the challenge of the outdoors

1565^NR^O^activity2^the place i am thinking of are the gardens situated about a block from my house. i love going there because every time im there the other people there too always looking so happy, whether they are on a lunch break sitting with collegues on a park bench, as part of a family group having a picnic or the constant stream of runners/joggers/walkers on one of the gardens many paths. everyone there has a purpose for being there and i like that. i also love the green lawns as that reminds me of when i was younger before the water restrictions started and everything was green! and love all the trees and flower gardens as it reminds me of being in the country (where im from) and is a place that allows me to escape the city life. the gardens are just big enough so when you go right into the middle you cant see roads/cars/buildings so it is a complete if only temporary escape. i like that it is temporary in a way; a short break out from the city life that is really revitalising before heading home. when i ride past the gardens at night though i hate it as there are many stories of bashings occuring in there. very hard to believe when there in the day time.

1577^NR^O^activity2^The weather here in Sydney has been so hot lately. Despite my concerns about my immediate professional future and that of my son\'s, I tried to focus on being in the outdoors and taking in my surroundings. I appreciated the beauty of the trees and being near water. I also appreciated the cooling nature of the breeze as it blew through the tree canopy. My thoughts were almost constant about my overriding concerns, with feelings of anxiety occasionally bursting through but I tried to quell those with self talk - about not creating my fears into reality and finding some sense of hope about the future. I really believe that I will feel far less anxious about my own professional concerns once my son has resolved his. This is a passing moment in our lives but I am very present to the immediacy of my emotions. I allowed being in nature to sooth me somewhat.

1570^CC^O^activity2^The first thing that I noticed sitting on my bed was that my room needs a good clean. Then I think there are better things to do on the weekend that clean my room especially in the heat (>30 degrees C in the house. I thought about how pretty my room is and how I am still happy with the decor despite it being years since I redecorated years ago. I thought about my son on his way to Japan to snowboard, hoping that he has a great time and that he and his friend looks after themselves and each other. I thought about my daughter who lives with me and what there is to be done about the beesting she suffered from a neighbours bees - thinking about whether everything that can be done has been done to treat the reaction she had. I wondered whether I should contact my lover to see whether he wants to hang out in the heat with me and decided that I would rather be on my own.

1553^NR^O^activity2^I went to the beach the other day as it was stifling hot in our house. The sea breeze was gorgeous on my skin, the sun was warm, the water was fresh and made my skin tingly... my back has been sore but the crashing waves soothed my pain... bodysurfing was fun I got dunked a number of times by the crashing washes and it made me feel alive and yet very small and vulnerable in comparison. I wanted to just swim as far out to sea as possible until I was a mere dot on the horizon, just drift away never to be seen again. At first I felt powerful but the deeper I got I felt insignificant

1601^NR^O^activity2^My house is surrounded on all sides by native bush, full of birds and other animals. I spent time watching birds, marvelling at the cycle of nature and the impetus which calls them to mate and continue the species. I was excited to see a Morepork that night, the first time I\'ve seen one live. I wanted to reach out and cup it in my hands and tell it how beautiful it was, then felt silly because it would be scared of me.  Some Sulphur Crested Cockatoos came over during the day, screeching loudly. I tried to send thoughts to them to keep away from the top of the hill where some bastard shot a cockatoo last week. After the shotgun blast, I heard it screaming for a long time before it died and wanted to go round there and turn the gun on the man (I assume it was a man) who\'d killed such a lovely bird. It upset me quite a lot.    Whenever I spend time looking at the bush I feel deeply grateful that I\'m here. I spent 22 years in the industrial city of Bradford, hating it and longing to live in the country. Now I do and I shall never become blase, or cease to be grateful.    I used to sleep outdoors in summer but since my arthritis now makes it difficult to get up from the floor, sleeping in a tent isn\'t practical and oh, how I miss that.      I love the smell as day changes to night and cools everything.   The creatures come out and rustle all around; possums probably that eat the native birds :-(  They have a very strange alarm call, like someone strangling or drowning. The first time I hear it, many years ago, I was lying in my tent in the field and I thought some maniac had sneaked up on me. Frightened me to pieces - but I soon learned who the culprit was.    Pukeko scared me too at first, they make a blood-curdling noise, all night but they\'re harmless - except to ducklings, which they kill.  I love the countryside; it makes me feel I am where I belong and I\'m sure it must be partly genetic as from the 1500\'s all my family were farmers. I was the first child of our family line ever to be born in the city and I loathed it from the first day I was aware.    In addition to that feeling; I shall never stop being grateful that I\'m back in New Zealand. For a few years I was exiled and it brought me close to breakdown. So I try to be aware and appreciative of what I have now.  At night, when I lay on the lawn and look at the stars, I don\'t feel insignificant at all. I feel part of this vast universe, just as the ants (which usually crawl into my ears) are part of it.  It\'s as if I\'m holding hands with everything.

1600^CC^O^activity2^I tried to notice how my body felt in the spots where it contacted the chair, and how the blanket felt sitting over me. I listened to the cars going past on the street outside. I breathed deeply; I felt a little fluttering in my stomach--nerves from something I had been doing before I sat down--and tried to calm it. (I can feel the flutter again now.) I thought about the issue I was nervous about and went over some possible scenarios in my head for how to address it. I felt a little worried about the future. I looked around the room at my possessions and thought about how I have many fewer possessions than other people I know, and how they are often exhorting me to decorate. I thought about some of the ways I\'d like to decorate, and some of my fears about doing so. I kept trying to bring my mind back to the present, and to my surroundings. I stared at the flame of the candle I had lit. I don\'t remember if I tried to smell it from where I was sitting, but I don\'t think I noticed the smell. I wondered how much time I had gone by since I sat down (I\'d set a timer).

I\'ll try to find what\'s wrong about my thinking process and the way I think about myself. I really want to know why I am so desperate and depressed even though I have some things that people might feel envy at me.

1609^NR^O^activity2^last night i walked down to get the mail with Fynn the dog and my adult son after dark. I intended to go much earlier but things happened and I didn\'t. I nearly didn\'t go but I had promised Fynn a walk and he was looking sad :-) and besides i didn\'t have the mail.   I took a torch but G persuaded me to turn it off and let my eyes grow used to the dark. There was no moon to be seen and cloud cover and it was quite dark. I stumbled a bit at first but after about 200 metres I was used to it and it felt really good to be trusting my eyes. The darkness was velvety and because I know the road so well the pot holes and ruts weren\'t a problem and in fact it was good not to be able to see them and be thinking \"I must do something about those\"!  It was comforting to be walking with G and we chatted easily. I felt sad that it wasn\'t with S but that has changed and only a miracle will bring him back so it isn\'t going to happen. I felt pleased with myself that i had made the effort, not only for the dog\'s sake but for mine as well. It was a bit cold (for summer) but walking 1.2km back up the hill soon warmed us up. I knew that the exercise was good for me after a busy day at school and even though i had already been to the gym it was good to be outdoors and on my property. I appreciated the fact that my adult son was happy to go walking with me especially as with his forthcoming marriage these times will be fewer. I\'ve made my share of mistakes in my life so far but I\'ve been and still am an effective mother, one with whom my children wish to be

1616^CC^O^activity2^Well, I spend most of my life in my livingroom. As I have a 7 month old son. He has learned to crawl, stand and now walk with his walker. And that is what I watch all day now. It is exciting, while stressful, as along with the excitement of watching him, there comes along his new scream. At the top of his lungs, the highest pitch he can make. And this isn\'t an I\'m in pain scream, it\'s an I scared myself scream. So it can get a little tense at times. I always am keeping watch to make sure there aren\'t things in his path, so I notice every detail of the room constantly. I don\'t really live the most exciting life, quite boring. Well, depends on what you consider boring, as my son is definately a handful, and definately not boring. But that is what I do everyday. Wait for my son to learn new things. Be in awe, happy, excited, and overwhelmed. It\'s great. Although there are other things not so great, but he is where I focus my attention 99% of the time. He takes you away from other feelings.

Right now I am working on obtaining employment and getting resettled in my life in Canada after having lived in South Korea for the past two years.  During my drive I thought about this, and thought about my life in Canada before I went to South Korea as I drove past areas that were very familiar to me.  I felt nostalgic, but also as if time really hadn\'t passed since I was last in the area, even though it was actually more than two years ago that I last was.

I sat on the shower bench attached to the wall and felt the \"disability\" bar dig into my mid-back.  It was very relaxing, knowing that no one could interrupt me while I was locked in the shower room. It was a more beneficial break to me than spending time in our staff lounge.  I really like \"quiet time\"!

Lying on the bed in my room, I look about at the walls, thankful that I had them done in a soft blue that reminds me of the clear sky.  I feel the new mattress and am grateful that I was able to afford it and that I chose one so fabulously comfortable.  I look at the new tv and again am appreciative of my ability to have bought it.  I feel the freshness of the room, having removed the old carpet recently and replaced it with wonderful cheerful wood laminate flooring that is so easy to keep shiny and dust free. I also feel a gentle but sweet sadness, realizing that my son, daughter-in-law, and two grandaughters have moved away, leaving me a bit vulnerable over the past few months.  Should a medical emergency occur for me, I would have no one close to whom to turn.  But I push the thought away and say to myself that I will stay strong and able.  Someday in the future I can move closer to them if I feel the need.  I think how glad I am that I paid for my home when I bought it instead of mortgaging it as my son had encouraged me to do.  It gives me a sense, a strong sense, of freedom that I would not otherwise have had.  I am grateful I live in a place with a warm sunny climate and mild winters.

1659^NR^O^activity2^I\'ve been sick the past week so I didn\'t have much of a chance to get outside and reflect.   I did however spend a lot of time last night looking out my window, just watching the night. There\'s a smoke stack very visable from where I am so i spent most of this time watching the clouds coming from it. My feelings were that I was a little stressed thinking about all the work I have coming up. I\'m worried about doing well in my courses. It felt peaceful to just watch out the window because its something i used to do a lot when i was younger. I would wake up and just sit at the window for long periods of time. i felt pretty content overall.

1657^NR^O^activity2^It was extremely hot, so I went to the park late at night.  It was already getting dark, but there was a cool southerly blowing in from the ocean.  The breeze makes me feel relaxed and cool.  I went to the park, which is about a ten minute walk from my house.  There were a few people there - a couple of kids kicking around a football, and about six of the older Greeks from my suburb having a chat and eating at one of the covered picnic tables.  Seeing those older people and their active community always makes me feel good.  I picked a spot that had lots of lush grass to sit on, and had a lie down.  I was under a tree - I enjoy looking up at the sky through the leaves of a tree, seeing the fractal patterns and trying to map them.  The breeze makes the leaves move, which generates more patterns - patterns make me feel good, and I relax while looking for them, like a mandala.  I\'m mildly concerned to notice that the kids with the ball are getting closer to where I am; I\'m only concerned because on a few occasions I\'ve been hit with the ball, which isn\'t a real problem it just distracts me from my thoughts, and makes everyone feel awkward in case I get angry (which I never do, but I have a really big beard which makes people concerned I might be that way inclined).  Thinking this I make a point of sitting up and watching the kids, smiling so everyone can see I\'m enjoying their game and am in a good mood.  After a couple of minutes of this I can lie back down and focus on the tree\'s leaves.    After about twenty minutes the mosquitos arrive and I bugger off home because the mosquitos really love me.    I take my shoes off while at the park.  Not wearing shoes makes me feel relaxed and calm.  It makes me feel something else too, something good, but I\'m not sure what it is; something that makes me enjoy myself.    The moon is already high in the sky before the sun has set, so I get the opportunity to look at it.  I always feel excited when I see the moon in the sky before dark; a moon in the sky during the day looks like an alien sky, and I get to thinking about what the sky looks like from other planets; as I was reading speculative science-fiction earlier in a magazine I think about this for most of the time I\'m at the park.  That always makes me feel exhillarated.

1632^CC^O^activity2^I was in my bedroom. I felt relaxed and calm and comfortable there. I noticed the softness of the duvet and afghan on my bed, the comfort of my pillows behind my back as I reclined. I was cozy and warm - not cold. I was comforted by the soft hues of pink and brown in the room (walls, linens). I looked at the many sea shells that I have displayed and their colours and textures, and the bottles of sand from beaches I\'ve visited. I felt safe and cozy and peaceful ... and a little drowsy, so I actually had a short, rejuvenating nap. I felt happy and blessed to have such a nice spot to relax and have a few peaceful minutes to myself and I thanked God for it.

1667^NR^O^activity2^Ty wanted to go to the pond and feed the ducks so we walked there on Shabbat. We looked at the other houses in the neighborhood on our way there and after circling them we found the path to the pond and walked over. I ran down the grassy area to the mud to be closer to the ducks and Ty followed after me. My sneakers got all muddy. Then we went to the picnic tables nearby and Ty went around to try to entice the ducks to come closer. Unfortunately he made \'come here kittie\' noises and the ducks went away. I sat on the table or the bench and looked at the pond. Almost all the trees surrounding it were bare and I remember thinking that they\'re not all the same type of tree, and that maybe I should write a list of names of common trees in Hebrew and in English, so that I\'ll have one unified vocabulary, that maybe I should do that with flowers too, maybe with birds... And then I started thinkin about flowers for the wedding and bouquets. There was a father with his little blond boy on the other side, and the baby boy had his shirt up, his belly exposed. There were four ducks, two grey and one with a pretty green neck. I couldn\'t deicde whether  the other duck was grey or colorful or some strange in-between. There were lots of leaves in the bottom of the pond, and there was a small piece of matza floating around and half a bagel. That\'s a lot of Jewish food for North Carolina. After wandering around in the mud Ty came over and hugged me really tight. He sat behind me and was holding me and I felt like some lucky girl I would stare at, of those happy-looking couples in pictures that come with frames. WE must have looked just like that.

1673^NR^O^activity2^It\'s nice to be outside for once, bit cold but I don\'t really mind the cold, part of being British.  Wish I could be somewhere else, somewhere nicer. Although I don\'t function well outside my comfort zone, theres always a desire to go places, do things but I\'m too poor to do it at the moment.  It\'s a community space where usually people interact, but I can\'t seem to even say hello to the two other people there, what if they ask questions, even the most mundane questions scare me, what do you do etc. Not a lot is the answer, spent my life doing my own thing which is usually the opposite to everyone else. I\'ve got the shortest attention span, ADHD, memory and organisational dislexia, high IQ, but together they don\'t work, I get bored, leave jobs I no longer feel challenging or cannot stand the politics and bureaucracy. Anyway sat looking at the nature around me thinking about how far detached I/we have become from it, usually on TV nature is portrayed as being in danger and needing our help or as a problem to us, often with a price tag. A fine example is the current snow, costing x million to grit the roads, x million because people can\'t get to work. Then as usual I started to think about the greedy bastards that run the world who have no idea about the amazing world we live in, instead everything has a money value, for example on the news the other day was a story about the government trying to prevent dementure which I thought was great until they said that dementure was costing the government x million a year and made me suspect that they thought it would be cheaper to cure it than deal with it and that was their only motivation. Anyway enough ranting, you get the idea of whats going through my head all the time, no matter where I am something is connected to the awful state the world is in and I feel guilty because I\'m unable to do any thing about it.

1675^NR^O^activity2^analyzing the thoughts or points of view that arise in awareness or whilst being aware is completely missing the point, awareness can\'t be described using conceptual frame works, awareness just is, this exercise is pointless, as soon as you start to describe, then you loose the awareness and dwell in the \'experience\' which is just a point of view or perception you had at the time, true timeless awareness can\'t be described through points of view it can only be experienced as it is.  this is what it is to be aware, not the description of and experience you may feel, this is only part of the information, so all the descriptions you may be gathering are just descriptions. if you really want to be aware then rest with out giving up for short moments until they become automatic. Its our true nature.

I love it to smell nice, it makes me feel good, especially when someone comes to visit. I looked  and saw I had piles of papers,books brochures,pens, and toys scattered around the room, which did make me feel annoyed, because I seem to collect things into piles everyday. I like the room to be tidy, so it motivated me to go through the piles and put them for recycling, or away in the right places. Then I felt happy because it looked good again. I received a package from the art school, from which I am starting a correspondence course, and felt extremely eexcited to open it. I had to apply for a training incentive allowance yesterday, to do the course, and it was accepted, so that made me even happier. I am excited about the course.

1682^CC^O^activity2^The place I chose was a comfortable chair in the living room. As I sat there I noticed the dust on the photos on the wall, the cobwebs up by the ceiling, how the carpet needed to be vacuumed and remembered I still need to order bags for the vacuum before this one is full, the way the newspaper is on the couch, the toys my five year old granddaughter didn\'t put away, the three book bags full of children\'s books... I noticed how much I don\'t really notice as I walk through that room so many times every day. I thought about how a stranger would see the room and what they would think. I wondered how much I care what they thought of my (lack of) housekeeping skills of late.   While living in the moment and finding joy when and where and as often as possible I tend to overlook the bigger picture. Whose picture is that though?   I take care of my 78yr old bedridden mother who is in the late stages of vascular dementia. Just trying to keep her clean to keep her skin in good condition and coax her to eat is some days all I can expect.   I\'ve had my granddaughter here for a month. I\'m spending my days trying to gather as many wonderful memories with her as I can. Not for me so much but for her. I want her to look back on this month and treasure the time she spent with Grandma and the somewhat loopy Great Grandma. The love and laughter we\'ve shared far outweigh the lack of tidiness in the living room. For me anyway. But seriously, how much time would it take to get the living room spotless once again? Make a point of having the little one help.  Now what about walls? Has it really been ten years since I painted? Goodness. Why is it I\'m noticing so much negativity with this assignment? Ah, I\'ve been asked to look around at the physical elements in my life. My joy and happiness is within. Thank goodness it isn\'t dependent on the elements around me. lol  Have a blessed day!

1685^NR^O^activity2^I felt engaged and absorbed as I tried to take photos of raindrops on the flowers in the garden. I could see the strong colours through the lense- orange, green, purple- taking up the whole vision. The air was moist and not cold and still drizzling, soft on the skin. I was a little concerned about rain on the lens but not much. I focused on getting the beautiful detail of the stamens on the flow and raindrops. And had a feeling of challenge and enjoyment when a bee landed on a flower and I tried to get a photo with both his eyes looking at the lens- like a scary monster. The garden was peaceful and there were no neihbourhood noises to disturb the peace as it was the middle of a work day. My home was only a few steps away with all it\'s symbolism of comfort.

It isn\'t a very relaxing place (but best of the options) because there is still a lot to do to make it relaxing.  Life has been so busy that at the end of the day I fall into bed which is usually still not made properly and fall asleep virtually instantly.  There are boxes on the floor still unpacked and the walls are bare.  I have books on a chair by the bed and a lamp but that\'s all.  Currently I\'m in a state of just making it through every day and achieving the essentials so the continued disorder of a half unpacked room is not very inspiring or relaxing but I am too tired to do anything about it yet.  I didn\'t have a great deal of thoughts while I spent time in there because I was concentrating on staying awake!

The noise of the poplars moving in the wind was quite loud but also a soothing, rustling sort of noise. There were lots of ducks quacking and flaping about and a whole lot of seagulls came to sit around me, thinking I was going to feed them. I really enjoyed the peace of the place and the humour of the ducks and seagulls. Even the fact that it was windy was quite pleasant and calming. I was thinking about a meeting I had just had and a task I have to complete and thinking of the best way to do this. The task is not necessarily the most pleasant task, but it is necessary and I was preparing myself to do it and convincing myself that I could do. I also felt quite hungry and decided that the first thing I would do when I got home would be to make myself lunch. Overall I would say I felt quite calm and content, and though I had a lot on my mind, I felt up to the task.

I was concerned by some winter damage that I will repair today, which brought me to serious thought;I spent time with my planters which I truly enjoyed. The \"smell\" of spring was in the air and it was actually warm and inviting in the direct sun which made me feel enthusiastic about days to come and approaching daylight savings time.

1724^CC^O^activity2^I realised that there is nowhere in this house where I feel comfortable. At all. We recently moved here from overseas and never saw the house before moving in because it came with my husbands job. We left most of our possessions back in the other country and so there is very little-practically nothing of me or my personality in this house. Nothing was chosen by me or is soothing or comfortable to me. We cant afford to buy anything at this stage.  The bedroom is the place I like most inside because it is bright and overlooks the farmland. Its not a bad size I guess. Whenever I stop to think though, I cant help comparing it to the house we had back home, that we owned and we had built onto, making it wonderful. We wanted to raise our children there. We lost it. Its very difficult to think about it so I try to keep my mind busy every second so I can pretend nothing bad happened and forget about my home. I have to look after my angel baby too so there is never an opportunity for me to just relax or enjoy a place. If I lay on the bed I had to try and entertain him as well or worry about what he was getting up to.   There are cobwebs on the ceiling. I dont know where there come from because I thought I got rid of them. I should do something about them but I just feel so numb that I cant get truely involved in anything and tend to let the housework slip.   The wallpaper is so old and the carpets look like they come from the 1950s. Not exactly my sanctuary.  I miss having a real home. We are moving again in June and could potentially move every year or 2 with my husbands job. So never a real home. And always just having to take the house that comes with the job.   I try to think of ways to make money, things I can do at home, my dreams, how much I want to study and get educated. I worked so hard at highschool and it was all a waste!  I cant shut my mind down for a minute and there is so much I need to think about and process that I haven\'t been able to deal with. I have no one I can talk to which makes it worse and I\'m very lonely. Thats why I try to hide in my books and the worlds they take me to, where i can pretend everything is great and that life still holds fun and adventure.  I wish I had a place that was bright, lots of natural light, a very comfy chair, beanbag or hammock. It would overlook a garden with a peaceful waterfeature and lush moist greenery. The sound of trickling water. Beauty. Birds drinking from a fountain. Or a place overlooking a bush teeming with wildlife. Nature. I long to get out and be part of it. I dont even have a drivers license though so I cant get out of the house really.   There are so many thoughts and issues that relaxing time is unlikely to be relaxing for me for quite some time still.

1741^NR^O^activity2^It was cold and snowy.  The trees were covered with a fresh 6 inches and the slopes were perfect powder.  The sun was shiny and the breeze was light, people were friendly and talkative.  Riding the lift I was thinking of what a perfect ski day this was.  Fresh powder an sunshine - it does not get any better.  There was a man coming down Al\'s full speed.  His form was a thing of beauty and it was obvious how much he was enjoying himself.  He gave a little \"yeah\" as he rebounded from a rather deep bump.  I was happy for him and for myself.  The fortunate few - maybe.  Lift 4 was closed due to avalanche control so I took Bambi down to Longhorn.  As I started own the narrow path, I decided Zagwa looked really fun  so I decided to indulge myself instead of challenge myself.    A man on the lift had a mustache which was partially frozen.  I remember wondering how it felt to have a frozen mustache but,I did not ask.  He was so excited it was contagious.  I felt lucky to share in his excitement.

1695^NR^O^activity2^At the beach with friends, on a beautiful, hot sunny day. A walk through the bush to get down to the beach, with amazing scenery and views. The beach itself was quiet, not too many people, with great surf. The current was strong, but with the surfboards it was great fun - exciting and exhilerating! This was a great day - after surfing, we lay in the sun listening to music and talking. We had a good group of people, and the atmosphere was a very happy one. Lying in the sun I felt content and peaceful, calm and completely relaxed. The walk back up the hill to the car was exhausting, but looking back down at the beach and how far we\'d walked made me feel happy and proud of how far we\'d walked. It was a gerat day :)

1737^NR^O^activity2^Everything stopped.  It stopped completely.  I decided as I walked home from work that it would be a good time to sit on a park bench and enjoy the sunshine.  It was ridiculous how different I felt.  From the moment I decided to veer from the path until the moment I returned to it, I felt like a different person.  I watched I bee, I saw a butterfly, and ants crawled on the surface of the bench.  Usually when I walk past that bench I\'m either on my way to work or on the way home with a head full of life, and day-to-day things I need to do.   When I sat down, closed my eyes, felt the sun on my face I really thought about the important things, things that I needed to think about.  Life events have been fairly major lately and I actually stopped and gave myself some time to think things through.  To work out how I felt about what we\'d learnt during the week.  It was good.  I felt incredibly different when I stood up from the bench.  I often think about how I should take time out to think but it doesn\'t happen often.  Being outside and alone was like I was being permission to do just that.  I felt peaceful after a week of feeling in turmoil.  The timing was particularly good.  Without going into specifics, I\'ve been dealing with a massive life-changing experience lately.  At times it has made me incredibly sad and at times I have felt okay about it.  It\'s the classic grief roller coaster.  I know that when I spent time outside just breathing the world in, I always feel better afterwards.  And yet I definitely don\'t make enough time in my life to do this.  I think that\'s enough, I possibly didn\'t stick to the brief!

1754^CC^O^activity2^Washing the dishes, I enjoy washing the dishes, its a place where I can look out over the garden see the clouds racing across the sky in the breeze, I noticed that the lemon tree needs pruning and the lawns have grown lots since the rain in the last few days. I like to do the dishes by hand because I can get them properly clean but I also get time to think,I was thinking about what to make for dinner and wondering what my daughter would be doing at kindergarten that day. Hoping that my oldest child would come home from school with a good story to read and that the kids would stop arguing over every little thing. The house was quiet because everyone was out at work or school and my youngest was in bed, I felt happy when I thought about his latest antics, he has discovered the joy of chasing balloons around and this morning worked out that flopping onto them makes them pop, we had great fun laughing at it. I noticed that the shopping list was falling off the wall and that I had suddenly got to the end of the dishes without even realising I was even halfway through.

1670^CC^O^activity2^One of my favourite places to go in our home is our lounge. It\'s very restful and has views of Wellington Harbour as well as the bush in our section. I go there first thing in the morning when I wake up to have my \'quiet time\' with God, reading the bible and praying. I also go there just to flop after walking home from work up the hill. I watch television in there and also my husband and I eat most of our meals in there. Our cats come in and relax also. I love looking out the window. The temperature in this room is cooler than the rest of the house. We are currently in summer and we have a south facing house which means this room doesn\'t get much sun but it has great big windows with a relaxing view. It\'s my sanctuary. I always tend to feel calm in this room and it has a neutral decor also so easy to unwind in.

1778^CC^O^activity2^I thought the room would give me a sure way to relax, although the room is also for practical uses.  I felt peaceful and humble while sitting in the room and while I was free to daydream, the room kept me very alert.  Although I felt free to think whatever I want, I also felt free of any drama, in the sense that I could sit there and be myself.  In the room, I noticed the gist of the practical objects, such as the utensil holders, which I think possibly subconsciously contributed to my tendency to think about drama-free thoughts - those objects subconsciously kept me grounded.  I also noticed that most of the objects in the room were of a dark color, so it was easy to delve into many moods at once and start thinking about everything because black symbolizes a moody color. That said, I mostly noticed what was in front of me, such as the objects on the desk and pretty much overlooked the objects elsewhere ie. the objects at the top of the desk stand.  Overall, I felt that the room gave me a balanced feeling of relaxation and alertness/awakeness.

1779^NR^O^activity2^I actually sat on a bench at my college. Belmont Abbey. It was quite peaceful.  It was a bit chilly, but it was good looking at people going to the library and the sidewalks made out of stone were quite empty, due to it being a weekend day. It is beautiful on this campus. There are religious statues all around and every now and then you still see a monk walking quickly by.  It makes me wonder  about when the school first open one hundred and thirty years ago.  I saw the flag waving with our motto To God be the glory.  It is a serene spot, the brick sidewalk is lined with trees and there is a slight breeze.  I wonder about the younger students here and what their dreams are.  Then I think about the adult degree students like myself and wonder what made them want to go back to school.  The grounds on the campus are taken care of to a tee. When I sat their I could feel many generations around me. I am grateful I don\'t have to be catholic to be a student here, while at the same time, I can feel the love of God all around me.  It makes me gave a since of gratitude that I was accepted at this beautiful college.  The chap pal has a big steeple and a big clock on it. Even though the college is only a few miles from my house, it seems like when I step onto this campus i am in a whole different place, reserved, yet liberal, rushing yet serene, inspiring and uplifting, It is amazing to see all the old buildings with the natural plants growing in and around them. I look at the theater on campus, and wonder what all the plays and musicals and dreams came true within those walls.  Down the road a piece is where approximately 20 monks live.  They have always been quite friendly to the students, it is kind of neat to see a monk walking around , it makes it seem like the Days of St. Benedict and then I look down at my calendar and it brings me back to this century. It is such a warm feeling. Down the road about one mile away is where the Sister of Mercy is.  They give to so many programs in our area..Holy Angels, Helps dying Aids victims, Help finding jobs for the mentally disabled.  It is such a comfort to be surrounded by such giving and gentle people. I want to use my Psychology/Education degree to help others, like these wonderful people are doing. It is a feeling of a large family even though I barely know anyone..it is a friendly peace in the air. I just sat there for about 45 min. my mind goes through the ages and it is such a peaceful hug like feeling to be a part of such a caring educational place. It is fun to watch the people and the culture of people. I hope I take time to do this again in the future, maybe when it is warmer in the spring.but it was nice taking a break from my studies to just take in the beauty and nature and feel of this beautiful well kept inspiring place filled with so many intellectuals and people learning new things.  I really feel blessed and honered  to be on the park beach today.

1752^CC^O^activity2^The room I chose was my daughters room, she is 4 months old (nearly) and I was there to tidy the room someone, put away clothes, remake the cot pull out clothes that were too small and spend some time thinkign about how to improve the room as she grows.. it will need shelving soon to care for her books and soft toys as we will soon be putting her in the cot rather than the mobile bassinet. The room is brightly coloured and fun to be in - I like the room as it is cosy and I love playing with my daughters toys and clothes. It is relaxing as nothing matters when we are in there and there are no time frames or expectations as she doesn\'t care what it looks like or if it is in perfect order. There is a bassinet, cot and single bed in the room and I often lay on the single bed looking at the room... I usually have my daughter with me in the room and she talks and giggles at me and we have little conversations which are fun and exciting. she loves to sit & watch as I talk to her about what I am doing , showing her the clothes or the toys I am movign or tidying... she laughs and waives her arms etc. So I feel happy, and loved and bursting with love for my daughter. the time in the room is rejuvinating as it is relaxing and fun, and loving. I have lots of ideas about what to do with the room, but I am a little apprehensive about movign forward with them as I know my husband and I need to watch the about of money we spend at present and it needs to also be done properly not cheaply so it lasts and doesn\'t look tacky, so all these thoughts are goign through my head also, but even goven all this I still feel relaxed and happy.

1721^NR^O^activity2^I was exhausted as had just finished a 7km run, but felt like I had achieved something as ran whole way instead of walking which I would have done had not been with someone else. Was happy and content just being with my friends out in the sun. A little bit cold - it was a windy day and found that a little bit irritating because I wanted to have a nice \"sunny\" day out with my friends and boyfriend but the wind was somewhat interferring with that. Remeber that the grass was slightly dry, but tickly and nice to put my feet on once I\'d taken my running shoes off. Thought about how often days like that (with my friends and boyfriend out in the sun just relaxing, chatting and chilling) will happen in the future, and if the new people I meet will be just as great as the current ones I know. Started to get burnt and was annoyed with myself for not thinking of something as simple as sunscreen (again- it is a recurring forget) we were watching the people all rushing to get into the bus line that spanned the length of the park (one of them being a friend of ours) and were wonderng why it is that they feel that they\'ve done what they came for and they have to go RIGHT now whereas we were all quite happy to sit in the sun listening to an ok band whilst enjoying company and conversation. Which in the end paid off for us as we were abke to jump on a bus after a 5 minute wait, instead of a 35 minute wait. Exhausted. Exhausted but content and happy were my emotions while in the park. More happy exhausting kicked in toward the end of the day.

The grass was cut short and we found some shade to the edge of the park, with picnic table.  There were hardly any clouds.  It was almost surreal.  There was a small stream running nearby.  We could hear native birds calling.  It was very relaxing as we sucked in the clean, fresh air.  Hardly anyone else was there.  After we ate some ham sandwiches and freshly made tuna and egg salad, we went to play with the kids on the swings down the hill.  You could feel the grass under foot.  As we played with the kids, you could sense the fun experienced by the entire family.  We then chase our 18 month old up the hill as she played and seek.  This dispite their being no place to hide, as we were in an open space.  We were surrounded by native trees, towering high.  The place was tranquil and I felt very much at peace.

My dog either curls up on my lap or brings his toys over and plays with them at my feet.  Even though it makes a mess, it\'s adorable when he shakes his stuffed toys and the stuffing flies all over the carpet.  The lighting is low, but the blinds are turned to let in some sunlight.  One of the windows is open to let in some cool air, so I don\'t get too warm under the blanket.  I\'m pleased with the decor and the soft color scheme, with a bright burgandy accent here and there to brighten the room.

1794^CC^O^activity2^When I\'m in bedroom with the windows and door closed, it is quiet and peaceful. I can see the house lights and street lights outside, as well as some stars in the sky. It calms me down and I can normally think best and clear at this time. Normally I would think over what happened to today and is there is anything I could have done or do next time, anything I can do tomorrow or in the future. It is a peaceful feeling if no one knocks on the door, but if someone knocks on the door, I would feel frustrated and angry.

1784^CC^O^activity2^I have recently moved into a new flat! My bedroom is the place that i have come to reflect upon b/c it makes me so utterly ecstatic.  I have found and created a place that is a perfect replica of what i was searching for. I made a list of what i wanted in regards to a new flat and new flatmates and sent it up to the universe. i have now a medium sized space, a beautiful queen size bed, a tv (which was a present), a desk (where im now typing)and a dresser- both of which were here waiting for me- a closet that i built, bookshelves that i created with cardboard boxes; artwork and presents and letters of encouragement from friends and loved ones on the walls...reminders to keep smiling and to always keep laughing. One bday card i got last year from a friend is a picture of an indigenous kid with a massive smile on his colorfully painted face and the caption reads \"Keep smiling, it makes people wonder what you\'re up to.\" Next to that are three gifts from old flatmates to make me laugh...one was a post-it note of a huge smiley face that he had stuck on my door while i was sad last year (which i removed from my door and had it hanging on my bathroom mirror all last year)- now it hangs on my wall in my new room. the second gift is called \"stick figure humor\" and there are two stick figurines- one is your traditional stick figure and the other is shaped in like a ?mark with two legs coming out the bottom. the regular stick person says to the question mark \"You\'re a real man of mystery\" and next to that my best friend sent me a cocktail napkin (from the states to new zealand, where im currently doing my MA degree in Religious Studies) that reads \"Its Happy Hour! (somewhere)\"  these were all little gestures to make me smile last year, as shortly before my arrival to new zealand i lost my boyfriend to cancer. it was a rough year to say the least, but im in this room now and this space is beyond positve! im ready for a new year and i\'ve got the most wonderful flatmates: all outdoorsy new zealand guys- two doing their PhDs, one in his final year of med school, another who works full time, and i forget what the last one is doing! my room is a private room on the under back side of the house. i live up a large large hill filled with luscious vegetation to get to the top. about a solid 20 minutes up Up UP! and coming down you can see the ocean and the Dunedin Harbor and the waves crashing at a distance. my flatmates are fishermen and hunters so every night there is wild and fresh caught fish on the menu or wild boar or wild venison (which i had for the first time the other night...quite tasty). my room is a place of new beginnings where i plan on having it be the place where i end my day, begin my day, and balance my life. it is clean, organized and well definately not fancy as i said i made book shelves with my cardboard boxes that i moved in and they are wrapped in my old light purplish sheets, and my closet is just a metal pole, but i used the other sheet to make a drape in front of it so my clothes are like being in a \"closet\"...ahhhh, the sun is peaking out and i have stuff i need to finish to get my student visa renewed in time...needs to be in 9 days...but it\'s comin together finally so all should be well!  this was probably entirely way too much random info...hopefully you can sift thru it and find what you need. in a nut shell, my room makes me feel serenity, new beginnings, hopeful, optimistic, growth, active, happy.

1802^CC^O^activity2^Been feeling really tired and tended to drift a sleep. I chose  spare bedroom room in the house and spend time in there after my wife and son have gone to bed. This is my time alone. I could hear the noises outside. Walnuts dropping on to a shed roof. A possum came past, making the growling sound they do when their territory is threatened. The light was fading.     I felt indifferent to things. Nothing seems to grab me this week and I could quite happily sleep through it. I feel between worlds. Like I do not fit in. Fantasising about other times or places. Yet I have so much in this world. Wonderful family and friends. A secure job. A house. very little money problems. This world just feels WRONG.    Various emotions. My son is to have an operation on his teeth (his milk teeth do not have enamel). Apprehensive about the operation, anger that he has to go through that, guilt that he has to suffer and I can\'t do anything to stop it. Fear. My first born died in my arms. I\'m scared to lose my other son.     My wife is pregnant and feeling morning sickness very badly. Thinking about her. Sorry she is so ill. Feel my love for her swell and try to heal her. Apprehensive about another child - more about my own abilities in taking care of two children, fear that they will be born with the same problems that my second son has, or that they may not make it. The past manifesting into the present and the future.     I feel tired now. Sad when I write about my first son.    Oh, I read some ones comment about their husband on facebook. The raw emotion that was attached to that hit me. It was very odd and stuck in my mind most of the night. Felt anger and then worry. But not my emotions. This has happened before.  Many times.

1804^CC^O^activity2^In my bedroom reading a book, on a monday, i had the day off after weeks of long hours, and i spent all day in bed, just reading, looking at the clock and counting off the hours, thinking as each hour rolled by \"i\'ll just read for another hour\" and before you knew it I had passed from day back into night. i read Frank Capra\'s autobiography. I felt warm and i didn\'t care that i wasn\'t being social at all, i didn\'t feel like a pariah, i just felt relaxed and like i had earned the right to be anti-social and alone and just staying in bed reading. it was warm but the air outside the blankets was slightly chilled, enough to chill my exposed fingers on the pages. a diffuse light examined through the curtains, and i could smell my own skin as one can after a nights sleep. i remember thinking that i should make more time for just being, for doing nothing at all, and for not stressing about doing, doing, doing, not making myself somebody - it made me think of that saying that to philosophize is to prepare for dying, and in an odd way by utterly being alone, i felt more human, more connected.

1796^CC^O^activity2^i dont really get thant much time to myself to relax or \"think for myself\" my mind is constantly in \"mother mode\" which i find really hard to switch off. The place i chose was my bedroom as my older child understands that it is out of bounds. but the only thoughts that would run through my head were how i was going to rearange the bedroom so that my youngest childs cot would fit in as she is growing out of her bassinet. the biggest thing i came to realise is that my bedroom has no useable corners. there is either a door or a window in every corner there for nowhere to put the cot. I was amazed that i\'d never noticed that before as i used to have a big thing about what could go into corners and what couldnt thats when i realized that my life has become that busy i dont even have time to be myself anymore.

1798^CC^O^activity2^Oh gosh... well I guess my cousin\'s at Somers. Spent the past few days there with friends which was nice. I was comfortable just lying on the couch, reading my book... \"The Mind of God\". Very interesting book, looks at the existance of God from a scientific point of view. Doesn\'t try to convince you one way or another, but presents the arguments. It\'s good. Just thinking, indoors really doesn\'t suit me, I\'m sooo much more comfortable outside. But yeah. I was happy there reading for a bit. But on the same note, sitting on that same couch a little later I was really grumpy... my friends we way too all over each other in my face. That gets bloody annoying, not only coz it is in the face, but also because they both know I get lonely, and seeing stuff like that just shits me. *sigh* I\'m not really sure if this is what you people want to read or not, slightly in a ranting mood. But yeah... hummm... So I guess in the first instance I felt at peace, relaxed. There was no-one else in the house I could just be, and figure out what I belive. Had some time to really get my brain in order again. The second instance, well I was bloody pissed off. Ah well, crap happens. Hope my ranting helps. Somehow I doubt it. Good luck!

I felt relaxed and serene and at peace with myself and the world around me.

1815^NR^O^activity2^I sit on the deck in the sun looking out at the plants in the garden and bush on the hillside. The sun is on my face and body, it is very warm. THe sun is glaringly bright but it feels good. The plants are growing bushier and bushier, it\'s like they\'re reclaiming their space. It reminds me of the impermanence of everything. I find that comforting, to know that everything passes, nothing is fixed. I try to see myself from a bird\'s eye view, of my place in this vast world and universe; to see myself as part of it, one and the same. It is very profound but I like to think about it, it comforts me and takes practice to feel it everyday.

1823^NR^O^activity2^I was at at lookout at night overlooking the beautiful lights of the city, whilst listening to music. It was immensely calming and helped me to appreciate the joys of life - beauty, tranquility, equilibrium, spirituality, hope, and a deep sense of peace and security. Fresh air felt cleansing, I was able to focus on being instead of worrying about my troubles. The music really seemed to interact with my experience and perception of the surroundings, and just quietly sitting on a bench with no one else around felt slightly surreal. It revitalised me to srive to reach my life goals with renewed zeal. I have tried to relax this way many times before but tonight everything fell into place and I could just \"be\".

The table and windows have many plants and flowers, the sun is shining through the window next to me. It\'s cosy and quiet, no TV, no one asking for attention for a while. The occasional sound is that of the pet bird. I feel relaxed and calm. The book is interesting and I can concentrate on it for a while. I don\'t feel distracted by something in the surroundings. I wish I could spend time like this more often without feeling guilty that I should be doing something else.

1827^NR^O^activity2^I sat in a local park eating dinner before going to a rehearsal. The weather was overcast but warm. At the park there are cricket practice facilities and lots of people were using these; families as well as organised teams from the local cricket club. I enjoyed watching the families play and was curious about the organised teams, as I will play against some of those players for my team! I felt relaxed about the rehearsal that I was about to attend, as I am confident in my ability to do this particular production. In these situations I often worry about time as I hate to be late. In this instance, however, I was very close to the rehearsal venue and had plenty of time to spare so I could relax. After I had eaten I went through the songs I had to sing at the rehearsal in my head. Feeling confident about singing and performing is the best that I feel in my life, so I was very happy at this point.

It was geting late, had had a full on day, felt tired and stressed. Sisters marrage nealry broke up, so I looked after the kids while they battled it out. This has probably skewd my results a little.   Had an exam the day before for summer trimester, so was concerned about that. Noticed that I felt anxious about it and at the same time didn\'t care anymore. This caused restlesness.  Deepest thought was what will happen if sisters marrage did end? How could I posistion myself to help look after two toddlers AND finish uni this year? Would I move in with them would it be required, would the offer be accepted? etc!

1805^NR^O^activity2^I sat on the porch and watched the rain. I thought about how stupidly hot it had been, and how it was now stupidly cold. I thought it was safe to sit outside because my ex-friend/boyfriend\'s ex-girlfriend who lives super close by definitely wouldn\'t be walking past in this weather and there\'s no chance I have to deal with her. I\'d like to think I thought wryly. I tried to disconnect myself from my own little world, get out of my head. I heard the rain hitting everything - and not me. Looking out at the trees and the white fence and the bleak clouds in the sky, i was reminded of the true enormity of my shit - so-called problems - in the grand scheme of things. Size zero, get over it. For some reason that makes me feel good. And I know that wouldn\'t be everyone\'s reaction to that  realisation. Uni starts in a week, i remembered, getting those scholarships really felt like a much needed confidence booster after 3 months of dead time between high school and uni, feeling stagnant, doing nothing with my life, working at a hair salon. I felt like i re-needed to feel like i can do anything. But i re-examine what i\'d been feeling, and realised that actually there\'s no question of whether or not i CAN, i\'d always known i could. So i decided that going into first year law like i need to work my ass off isn\'t a bad thing. I got excited!

Close friends were there in spirit (via phone in 2009 lol)making me sure of the choices i was  making withmy life, assuring me that i was  making desicions that were i my best interest and only going to better my life. Making me feel more sure of myself and what i want to become. All is well in my world and my head. my breathing is never stirred and nothing could ever bother me here.

The nature is amazing and everything is so colorful, you can see the sky and the city almost touching each other in a wonderful and peaceful way, i can see a storm coming and i can almost hear classical music with it. I felt peace, wonder, love and the biggest joy in my life. My husband was with me and I couldn\'t contain myself to admire his beautiful self, I knew I was going to miss this place and I knew I was going to cry when it was time to leave the mountain and leave my country. The storm hit us at the top of the mountain where we were with the old Land Cruiser, the greatest excitement and some other feeling that i can\'t describe invade my body, cause my husband told me we needed to go down the mountain in the Land Cruiser with the rain.  I think that feeling was adrenaline, everything turn into mod in seconds, one of the tires of the truck was hanging out of the edge and we were only in 3 wheels it was scary, but the greatest feeling in my life. My son thankfully was not with us, usually we take him(he was only months) but we knew we were going to push it this time.  Coming down the mountain the truck slided quite a bit, we felt like we were skateboarding :).  I forgot to mention it but our goal was to drive the Land Cruiser to the cross at the top well when we got to the bottom of the mountain we got out of the truck and it was heavenly, the cross was the only one showing in the middle of all the rain clouds and fog at the top of the mountain. That was the experience of my life, that was the greatest and excited of all, we went several times that year but that was THE ONE!!. Since then we haven\'t done anything and our kid is almost 4 years old now. Sad but this country

1803^NR^O^activity2^I have little time to spend reflecting at the moment, I have worked a really long week and it was fantastic to just be somewhere (although it was close to where I live) that was full of life and serenity. I chose a park down the road, lay on the grass and watched the clouds.    I was taken back by the beautiful bird song and although the occasional car drove past, I was able to focus clearly on the natural sounds, blending the manmade ones in so that there was a symphony of relaxing sounds.    The grass was harsh in places where it touched my skin, but soft where I was clothed and it was warm from the day. The trees were full of life, it is the middle of Summer here and cicadas were sounding out mating calls, birds singing and cats crossed the path.    I felt relaxed for the first time in a couple of weeks, and the need to connect more often with nature, to holiday again soon. I also felt a little cold as the sun went down as well as a little damp from the receding sunlight on the grass.

1822^CC^O^activity2^In my room I have been feeling blue, when out of the room I feel more content and alive. The walls are painted a honeycomb colour which reflects the sunshine late in the afternoon. I like to sit on my bed looking out of the window into the front yard. Feeling tense and overwhelmed I go into my room and turn on the music...Or perhaps do cross-stitch, the repetitive stitching is soothing. But when I sit and do nothing or contemplate on why I feel blue it gets worse and I end up irritated and annoyed at anything. Being alone is okay with me.

1834^CC^O^activity2^I am in my livingroom watching my cat sleep in her house and it makes me happy and sad. Reminds me of my dog that passed away last May. I miss her a lot and I think about how special she was to me. She showed and taught me unconditional love and I will always remember her for that. I look over at her memorial I made for her for a couple minutes. It upsets me because I haven\'t finished it yet, and that makes me angry that I have no motivation to do the things I enjoy. I\'m confused now cause I don\'t even no what I enjoy anymore. I feel alone even with my cat and my friend playing on the computer beside me. I think to myself is this going to go one forever cause it sure feels like it\'s never ending.

1850^CC^O^activity2^Noticed the softness of the bed and sheets, the sounds of cicadas outside and a light breeze. I noticed the photos of me and my girlfriend and started thinking about how the relationship would eventually end, but also some of the fun times we\'ve had. Started thinking about what im doing as far as university goes and how im reconsidering doing a \'gap\' year before uni. I feel its pointless and also impractical as its extremely hard to get a job as the economy is in a \'recession\', which the media has been hammering into me the past few days. Thought about how id like to be on a beach in fiji, preferably pulling in a large fish on the fishing line. Thought about how cool it would be to be i na band and travel and play music. Thoguht about the lives and times of ancient greek philosophers and how i wouldve love to live back then.

1853^NR^O^activity2^I spent 2 hours in the garden weeing and cutting back bushes. I noticed that the spring bulbs were starting to flower and wanted to clear the old leaved off so they could be seen. The start of spring makes me feel better as I hate the dark days of winter in Scotland the days are so shrot but they are lengthening now. It was a warmish day for the time of year about 7-10 degrees. last week it had been snowing and below freezing. It feels better to be doing something outdoors again. I love plants and want the garden to be wild but colourful all seasons. It\'s difficult in winter but can be done by using pots of plants in the green house.  I just feel more cheerful in among the plants.

1846^CC^O^activity2^I spent time in my bedroom. I first sat and relaxed on my bed and just noticed a lot of things in my room, such as my wall covered in pictures, my neatly made bed, and the bunkbed which looks like a tornado hit it, since it is covered with fresh laundry, school books, and other random things. After that I went to the back of my room and went on my trampoline which I recently purchased for myself. I jumped on it for a few minutes, and also did some stretches while jumping. After I got a little tired, I lay down on the trampoline with my feet up - which is a yoga pose which is supposed to energize you. All in all, I had a relaxing and invigorating time while spending some bonding time with just myself. Regarding the emotions perspective, it was just plain relaxing.

1862^CC^O^activity2^erm, well, oh my gosh theres a time limit? well now im panicking because i dont have anything of use to say! when i was in my room i noticed that 2 boxes on top of my chest of drawers dont fit properly because one is sideways... i also noticed what a tip my room is, but i couldnmt be bothered to tidy it up... when im in my room i tend to just sort of sink into myself, my own thoughts. il just start day dreaming, well not day dreaming as such, il start running scenarios in my head that are on my mind, like il run through a university interview or a confrontation with my step dad or telling my best friend a secret. i get lost in my own little world of what ifs...  so my experience of being in my room has very little to do with my room. i know the task was to notice stuff but my room is plain; magnolia walls, white ceiling, baige carpet, but i do have a blue lampshade, which isnt straight. there is lots of fluff on my carpet too, needs a good vacuum. and so much dust its unreal, no wonder i go off in my own world, this place is a dump! gosh theres even bits of balloon on the floor from my 18th, though that was only a week ago... something else i noticed was that the person who last lived in this room wrote something on the wall but couldnt get it off, i think its german or something \'schinceschone\' but i dont know if thats more than one word, or even if those are the right letters. my head board has lots of little chunks taken out of it, like with a knife or something, and a sad face carved into it, the person who used to own this bed had problems in my opinion (this is a rented house and they left the bed here, which i now occupy). gosh this room is so drab, i think im going to clean it, then arrange things a bit differently to try and make it more me, i still have cardboard boxes left out from the move, which was 6 months ago, but i am reluctant to unpack properly as il be packing again when i go to university in september. however i think it would be good for me to make this a lot more MY space, a place where i can just be me in a room that is like the essense of me, people would be able to tell that its my room, i think id like that... maybe i will do that...  you know what else iv noticed? that my teddy i got for my 18th has a key, as do many 18th birthday things, but i suppose where you are its 21st that you get keys, but either way why a key? what does the key symbolise? now you\'re an adult you can open more doors of opportunity or something crap like that no doubt...  i think iv written just about enough, especially if someone has to read through all of this rubbish iv been saying. sorry for the rambling. i do that. btw im a psychology student at school and its what il be doing in university so when you get the results will you email them to me please! thank you :) also sorry for the many many typos in this text...
