1093^NR^O^activity6^I am thinking about a tree on a small island in the Gatineau River.  This place is so interesting because the trees are on their own, separate from the forests across the river.  I imagine what it would  like to be the tree - peaceful on the island.  In the winter it would be so isolated.  No one could get to the island and the tree would be alone in the winter landscape.  Teh river would freeze and snow would fall.  There would be no boats, no traffic.  It would be incredibly peaceful.  If I were the tree I would be happy to be alone on the island.  I would spend the days blowing in the snow.

Okay, well I love the tapestry that is in my bedroom. it looks like it is set in farm country in Ireland. It is the most perfect looking place. The colors are beautiful, and it looks peaceful to me. I wish that I could live there are have a simple life there. I guess my prespetive of the world would be different if I were living there. I would be happier I guess. I think that I just wnat a simple life like the one I can imagine if I lived there.     I think that the life in the tapestry would be one of bardering with people, going to a market, and living off the land, but I would miss my shopping, I guess I would like to live a life like imagine in the tapestry, but with modern luxeries to, but that would not be easy.     I hope that this answer is what you were somewhat looking for, I was not sure what to write.

I imagine myself as the sun. I am looking down on all the tourists as well as locals who are out on the beach or by the pool soaking up my hot rays. I can see the peoples skin tanning and burning from my heat and can see the grass burn and in need of watering. I see the flowers withering and slowly dying from my intense heat. The fruits are rippening under my rays and are getting ready to be picked and eaten. Upon imagining I\'m the sun I have a more broad perspective and take into account all the toher individuals who are on the island and enjoying the beautiful weather and sights. I feel the warm sun on my skin, making me feel warm all inside. I can feel the sweat dripping down my face and soaking through my clothes. Oh how I long to be in that warm place surround by oceans and beaches.

(everything is so discolored). i land beside it and i see the yellowing grass all around me and everything is so hard and cold and the wind forces me to squeeze my claws into the ground so i do no succumb. when the wind relents i fly again into more white, more grey.

1116^CC^O^activity6^The first place that came to my mind was a hotel lobby. Most hotel lobbies tend to look the same. Clean and full of brochures and welcoming individuals. I\'m picturing a shelf by a mirror full of brochures and travel planners for tourists. It seems like a stereotypical shelf for every hotel. When I think about using this perspective, there doesn\'t seem to be any flaws. I\'m picturing a hotel lobby as if I would have seen one in a movie where all flaws and mistakes are taken care of -- for the most part. There are no stains anywhere, no rude people, all the lights are working, etc. I believe that when taking a perspective that I choose, I eliminate any obstacles or irregularities that do not fit with my schema of the situation. It\'s sort of like a fantasy or a utopia of my perspective.

The construction guys have made a mess and will only clean up when they are done, so the room will essentially be filthy for another week or two.    I\'m completely covered by old papers, sheets, junk, and photographs.  They feel heavy, but as a cabinet, I have to carry the load.    The room is cold and cobwebbed.

In my prespective it is getting extremely cold and I am really stressed about collecting nuts and building a warm and suitable nest for hibernation through the winter. I would be afraid of everything that was bigger than me (which is virtually everything). The trees and buldings would be my only refuge from potential dangers. Every garbage can that I passed by would be like a super market where everything is free. I would have to rely on pure luck for a way to survive. I feel very cold at this time of year and feel very intimidated by the snow and slush everywhere as this is not my ideal living condition.

Sometimes I melt before I hit the ground, and disappear for a while, but I know I\'ll be back. I feel very calm...there\'s something soothing about having no worries and only drifting softly, slowly, being able to appreciate the beauty of the world. I am also aware of the ugliness-- mainly that has been inflicted by humans. Pollution makes it difficult for me to see where I am going, and it coats me in a layer of chemicals. Mostly, I am serene and calm and cool and peaceful.

I\'m getting a bit warm, but I\'m too curious about my new surroundings to pay much attention to the stifling heat.     I look around for anything that might look somewhat familiar, and my vision lands on a wooden chair and table in the corner. The fire is still crackling merrily inside me and, though I\'m starting to get a bit warm, I get the urge to throw the chair on top of the fire. It\'s an old-fashioned oak chair and the table matches it.    I\'m still a bit warm, but I continue to look around. There\'s really nothing else in the room except for some wood panelling on the walls and a couple of books lying, cover down, on the table. It\'s really warm, and I can\'t help but feel kind of lonely in here.

I would appreciate the little things, like laying around, or being fed, having someone play with me. I could watch birds, chase squirrels, it would just be very different.

If I were a bed I would feel very closed in and bored. You can never go out or see anything new of the world, you are pretty much stuck in the little space of the room that you are in. What I would see is different objects that are also in this small space and that also never get a chance to see anything else, but this little room. I think that I would be happier if people were there as long as they don\'t do anything inapropriate or stupid on me. I don\'t mind if somebody sits or sleeps on me but I would hate it if there were a whole bunch of people that would just sit and weigh me down. I would still enjoy the company and the conversation that would go on and dare to dream of one day having friends and being able to talk to them and move around.

I would not be confined to seeing little parts of the world.. I would see the whole picture. This would allow me once again to feel superior.

I\'d feel pretty useless considering I have to watch all the people pass me on their way to work and school and other meaningful tasks.  I would finally know how many people live in the suite above me.  My person guess is 7, but as a tree I\'d be able to get a more accurate count.  As a tree, hopefully I\'d be a lot less tired and stress, seeing as how I just have to stand all day.  I\'ve been really tired lately as a person, and it doesn\'t matter how much I sleep, I always feel groggy and gross.  People would seem slightly smaller.  Being bigger than other people would be different.  I\'m a fairly small person, and sometimes I wish I could be larger and more intimidating.

The room is very open and I can see everything that is going on. It is not a bare room but it is far from cluttered. It is kept relatively clean at all times and it has a peaceful and private feeling about it.

I imagine, from this point of view, that I would be very observant of those around me - gestures, expressions, body language.  I also would be very much apart of peoples\' conversations; from a relaxed conversation, an angry conversation, a conversation about betrayal, conversations about planning futures together.  I would feel the tension or ease of a patron sitting on me - whether it\'s a nervous foot tremor, footies between a new couple, angry kicking feet of a toddler.  I imagine experiencing bliss to blistering anger in a very short time depending on the patron and their physiological responses to their current experience.

I would feel sort of violated if someone sat on me at first, then i\'d get used to it, obviously, because people would be playing me constantly. Id have no choice but to embrace it. Looking straight ahead, i would see a white brick wall, possibly some tiny writing on it too. Looking left, i would see the door to the school hallway, with that one skinny window looking out; i would see the blue lockers outside. Looking to my right, I would see the door to the CPRI part of STA, with its skinny window covered up by white paper! The CPRI hallway isn\'t the most exciting and interesting room in the world, so unless people are in there, there isn\'t much to look at. The floors are white, as are the ceilings! I actually would be very bored being that piano, unless people like the one writing this right now came and played me as often as he did. I feel like if I was even slightly out of tune, i would be very annoyed, not wanting anyone to play or hear me until i was retuned. I\'m very impatient that way, and i\'m sure the person playing me wouldn\'t mind or even notice if i was a little bit out of tune, but i would be totally self-conscious of it.

I make everyone happy.

As I go for a walk down the gravel road I look over to my right and I quickly see the faint image of a deer running by in the woods, I guess I must of spooked him. Overall I feel a sense of belonging and a calmness sets in over me.

The sky is a grey colour, adding to the sense of frigidness that is aided by the cold air. Clouds roll quickly above, through the sky, continuing to pour snow over the landscape. Trees shudder under the weight of the new fallen snow. There are crisp icicles forming on the edges of all the buildings and as people walk between these buildings, they are noticeable: bundled up in warm clothing and their breath is visible in the frigid weather temperature.

You can see secret fights outside classrooms to friends sharing gopssips while walking to lunch.

You become invisible, both a blessing and a curse.

1395^NR^O^activity6^As the wind\'s perspective, it would be an experience almost indescribable. Essentially sight doesn\'t exist in the normal sense of what we consider as \"seeing\", but if it were possible, the vision would be rapid and a complete rush, constantly. Feeling is more useful for the wind than sight, for it is able to touch essentially everything in its path as it brushes along the area. The area I chose was the long narrow path that is behind my school that runs besides the river.      There is a forest there, not a large one, but a small and narrow one that parallel\'s this path. As the wind, one could rush through it in a \"breeze\". It isn\'t more to describe than there already is too the wind. Logically, I can\'t write down in mere words of the perspective the wind. The only reason why I chose the wind in the first place was not because of the difficulty, but based on its sheer force and ability to move quickly. As the wind, you are not restricting to one place. Of course the forest behind my school has a sense of peace serenity, but one would get bored as the wind, therefore the reasoning behind rushing by at incredible speeds at times. I know personal experiences tell me that there are nice calm breezes that the wind takes on, maybe focusing on the things it “touches”. The logic and understanding of the wind of comprehending is difficult to say; but if it were possible, it is almost the ability to see everything at once in detail and to move about quickly.    Maybe as the wind, there are no such emotions available. No one can “see” you, but the effect is evident and the power held over others is enormous. Yet, since there is a lack of emotion, in my opinion, there is no bias or greed with the power. There is no justice/injustice, no morals run by the wind. It is what it is, and it does what it does, according to it\'s nature.

I walk up and down the ridge looking and smelling for something I want to eat or take with me for later in winter. Out of the corner of my eye I see movement as a tall lumbering figure comes out of the stone building.   I wait tense on the box wondering if it has seen me, and if it is dangerous. It walks my way and comes too close for comfort. I leap and squiry off the box and onto a nearby tree. I run up as fast as I can and hide in the branches looking down. The figure keeps walking. It wasnt a threat this time.   In the trees I am free to go in any direction I want. I leap and run from one branch to the next looking down for the next choice spot to get food. I can travel up in the trees away from the dangers on the ground.

Some peopl even start talking to themselves, some make conceded comments and strange faces.  Some people give themselves pep talks, encouraging them to suceed in their oral presentation, or to take a deep breath because tomorrow will be a better one.  Other people try to make sure their outfits are properly fitting, doing a fabulous twirl infront of it.  The mirror gets to see everything, and as people peer into it, reflects what they do or do not want to see.

The trees below are green and full.  As I fly, I feel the breeze rushing over me.  I\'m not tiring but feel energized. I can see far off into the horizon, there are no limits.  I see mountains, hills, and some grasslands. I feel relaxed as i continue to soar.  I choose to rest on the top of a tree for a few moments.  I can see other birds and some animals from where i am.  I can also see a river flowing nearby.  I hear the water rushing by.

The christmas tree is overly decorated as usual, looking beautiful and there are an abundance of presents underneath. Although there is a light snow the sun is still shining, and the weather temperature is perfect.

Being a waterfall would definately be a cool experience.

While i do not move there is much movement around me, people, objects, wind. The people are the most interesting to watch as they often appear to have different expressions and moods. One of the people that live in the room has been sick, as a result she seems sad. Sometimes people come in with very high energy and often look foolish tumbling around. What is the purpose of their lives? and what is the cause of their shifting moods. These people are so lucky to be able to move about, yet they spen dmost of their time crawled up in bed, i wish i was able to go out and see what is beyong these four walls.

This would be during the holidays and all my family is coming and getting together and spending time together. I am using pots and pans, spoons, knives and forks and setting the beautifully decorated table. The table consists of over 10 places. If I look back and reflect back into the real world, my perspective on time has changed. I think people should take the time to breathe and maybe just enjoy each day as it comes and not take things for granted. I feel that we should always be there for eachother and that nobody should ever let go the ties of family. Back in the kitchen I join in with the women of the family as they talk, laugh enjoy and cook.

The water is beautiful bright blue and the other fish and sea creatures are just as striking and colourful. Because I have taken on the perspective of a fish, I am to see the world from a new view because I am constantly underwater and close to other fish and sea creatures. Everything is very clear. Each fish flows easily in the water, just like me. To swim is calming and the cold ocean water feels good on my scales. In the distant I can see the motion of a large whale swimming gracefully. Around me small fish seperate and hide under the coral away from their predator. I swim and out of the coral allowing myself to take in the beautiful colours and view of the underwater life. I like the look of the other fish and the silence of the ocean. I feel happy to be underwater with other creatures who are just like me and I love the relaxing feeling that swimming brings me.

I would be able to notice the little details that are missed while walking on the ground. I would also be able to study how people interact and what they do in a day. I would feel so free and i would know that knowbody could catch me or even realize i was around. I would be able to be nosy and i know i would get very curious.   I think i would feel rather sneaky at times, but i know i would enjoy myself. I would need a friend to enjoy the experience with though. I would get very lonely if i was all alone for too long. But when i was alone i would enjoy this time and probably sit in a tree and watch over the downtown area or go to a lake and watch people and their dogs and kids play.  I would fly around and listen to the wind go by me as the river flowed and the sun beamed down on me. It would be so hot but because i was flying i would cool down, everything would be perfect.  I would feel very calm, like nothing could ever ruin the moments of flying around so free.

Most likely, I would realize everything seems bigger and then be afraid of what I was seeing. I think that I would feel the wind all of the time. It would take me and change me. If I were not flying, I would peer at everything around me, trying to take in my surroundings. Perhaps I would be trying to find food or a place to build a nest. Trees would hide me and protect me from predators or the weather.

I enjoy watching my kids play at school from up high. Makes me smile. It\'s interesting to see the road work and the twists and turns of the paths through my neighbourhood. It\'s very relaxing.

Everything feels so steady and I feel strong and confident in my spot.

1478^CC^O^activity6^I am a glass sitting in a cupboard. It is dark and quiet. I sit patiently, waiting for the opportunity to serve my one true purpose, to hold beverages. I sit with many other glasses, competing for the front row spot to better my chance of being picked. We struggle to be picked first. Some of the glasses are practical and simple, while others are pretty but fragile. As a combination of the two, I am certain that I will be picked. When the cupboard door opens the light shines in like a signal of what is to come. A hand reaches in towards me. Could this be it? The hand has almost reached me. It gets closer and closer. It grabs my handle and starts to pull. This is it. I will get to fulfill my dream and hold a nice frosty beverage to quench someone\'s thirst. But wait! The hand leaves my handle. It reaches a shelf up and grabs a mug. Oh horror of horrors. I have failed in my duty to hold beverages because my glass frame is not suited for a nice hot chocolate. CURSE YOU WINTER FOR BEING SO COLD! I can\'t wait for summer. Although lemonade leaves a sour taste in me.

1357^NR^O^activity6^\"There was a bug who spent his entire life in the world’s most beautifully designed persian rug. All the bug ever saw in his lifetime was his problems. They stood up all around him, he couldn’t see over the top of them, and he had to fight his way through these tufts of wool, in the rug, to find some crumbs someone had spilled in the rug. And the tragedy of the story of the bug in the rug was this; that he lived and he died in the world’s most beaitufully designed rug, but he never once knew that he spent his life in something which had a pattern.\"    Being a slave to gravity, my perspective in the world is not unlike the bug in the rug.  I believe it would be quite enlightening to be able to see my everyday life from a dramatically different view; to be able to see every thing in context.  In the physical world, this would mean taking on a bird\'s-eye-view.  In viewing things from above, there would be the opportunity to take the focus away from person-to-person interaction (as conversation would not be easily viewed from overhead), and switch it to observing the topography of the world.  Patterns hitherto unseen might become visible, and all spatial imaginings could be reconsidered.  When observing people, there would be no knowledge of the individual, but rather the movement of groups.  I believe to see things from the ground is to have an awareness of self, and to see things from the sky is to have an awareness of community.

You could see different people, observe their moods.  People would be busy, alert, or taking their time, on their cell phone, listening to music.  Some people would be with other people talking, laughing, and enjoying themselves, others would be thinking about what they are at the University center to accomplish.  You would feel very socialized as many people would pass by you all day, but you may feel lonely at night when the building closes.  You would enjoy yourself if you like watching people and their different moods, situations, and circumstances as the door of the University center.

People use me for all sorts of things. Mainly to look at themselves.  While their brushing their teeth, or picking their nose, I see it all. They have no shame really. I won\'t tell anyone!  I only wish that I could see more of the world! I only see this one room, all day. Its not a very big room either, just a little bathroom. Its not like I can be taken off the wall either! I\'m there permanently.  I do like it when I get attention though. Whenever someone cleans me, I feel as good as new. I like it when they use Windex!   Its kind of weird seeing people naked all the time, but I guess I\'ve gotten used to it. Like I said, they have no shame because they know I\'m not going to tell anyone!  I do like my size too. Bigger is better with us mirrors, so I\'m satisfied.

1488^CC^O^activity6^I see hundreds of teenagers a day.  Smiling... fighting... joking around... crying... looking anxious... looking excited... fall in love... falling out of love... I see all of their lives together.    It\'s comforting knowing I\'m the thing they center around.  That so much of their young lives happen around me, whether they notice it or not.  They usually don\'t.  I don\'t think they usually look at me, like, reaaaally look at me... sometimes they gaze my way, but lost in their own thoughts, not thoughts about me.    Still, I feel content.  There is always something new happening.  Always something to make me curious, keep me fascinated. Sometimes I feel sad, wanting to help them with things I\'ll never be able to, or to be a friend to someone that thinks everything is going wrong.    But usually I am happy, because this is a happy place.  It is warm.  It is friendly.  It is their home away from home.  Being a centrepiece to a room so central to their world, even though I cannot communicate with them, feels someone important.  Kind of like the friend that always listens... soaks up everything... but never says anything back, because a lot of times, people don\'t want to hear anything back.  They just need to vent.    The world is complex.  There is never a dull moment when you take the time to watch and listen, even when you have all the time in the world... it never gets dull.  There is always something happening.  Always something going on with people below the surface.  And after a while, I imagine you\'d start to see below the surface... The facial twitches and body language would start to be as good as language.

I would probably see the world in a much less serious way if I were to live in a place like this. The world would be an assortment of vibrant colours and have a happy, joyous atmosphere. I\'d notice the trees were greener, sky bluer etc. I would think that someone who lives life from this perspective would, at least subconsciously, avoid anything that would make them unhappy. At least, I don\'t think I would worry as much about stuff if I was raised in such an atmosphere. Things are definitely less complicated from this perspective. The world is comfortable, people are happy and greeting. I don\'t know how I would feel, necessarily. On the one hand, I\'d probably be happy inside this colourful room but then I would not understand if I met someone who didn\'t live in my situation.

I like it when people make silly faces at me but hate it when i see them after they have been crying or maybe while they are crying.

I see the wall in front of me, the table above me, and the thick, comfy carpet below me; nothing too exciting. it would really suck if a fat person sat on me, or someone that had a smelly ass, or had gas. But other than that it wouldn\'t be such a bad life, eavesdropping on the people that live in the apartment, or cuddling with the fuzzy cat that loves to sit on me and keep me warm, life is actually pretty sweet!

I never shine at night, thus I can be depended upon and reliable. I feel aloof and untouchable. Nothing anyone does can touch me. I am needed and loved. I am the center of the world - there if anything goes wrong. I can replace the watches and clocks of the world. I can replace the lamps. Days and nights can be controlled by my presence.

This forest is full of memory and emotion, and right now I feel very tired. I am tired of incessant creatures crawling up and down m trunk, I am tired of the trivial squabbles of the humans and similar races, I am tired of staring at the same dark green bush and the same berry plant day in and day out. On that note, I am going to slowly walk down the hill for a better view and a more interesting life.

I would hear the wind ruffle the leaves, and animals chattering as they hangout in the branches. As a tree, I would be tall and strong. I would be like a protective mother, providing a safe place for animals to go when a storm hits. If I were a tree I would feel like I have great purpose in life, but I would always be longing to move around (since tree\'s can\'t, they are planted in the ground).

Like the trees, the tree house used to seem so much higher up, complex, and amazing in every way. But picturing it, i only see a small little tree house, 3 meters in the air. I;m kind of upset on how much its changed, how the wood has rotted, and the latter up to the top is no longer safe. Trees and bushes have grown into it, and it is no longer the same place as it used to be when i was younger.the place where our imaginations would run wild, is just a rotting old tree house. however looking at it, i can still see my brothers and mine hand prints.

They have four pairs of segmented legs, and can grow a new leg if they lose one. Most spiders have eight eyes, and they do not have antennae or wings.I would be in a corner of a porch observing the traffic go by,but unlike a human i would protect myself and provide for myself and just create new webs .I now feel as if i have no worry except for being the prey of birds and wasps. I am an observer i sit back and enjoy, watching the busy traffic and people around me. I see rushing traffic and people walking quite quickly past,buyt it does not effect me i have a view from every side and i am protected and do not have to be bothered. My surroundings are a web in a small corner of a porch on a house thAT IS LOCATED  JUST OFF THE HIGHWAY. I reall y do not have many worries. I see leaves changing and leaves still falling off trees and i see muddy, slushy, weather beginning to come around but i am tucked in my corner.

From the view of my outlook, you would think I am filled with money, but I am not in actuality. One day I will be this girl that I am staring at. I\'ll have a lot of money with my education and be able to represent a woman of independent success, with money and happiness.

There is a river running through it and you can hear the water crashing on the rocks.There are trails with cute little bridges going over the water. At the end there is this neat cliff that you can stand on where you can look up the river and see the water coming down in a white water kind of way. I remember on summer is was so hot we would go there every day to cool off. There was this one little branch off from the river that had a much slower pace of the river. In one spot you could sit in the rock and it felt like a jacuzzi. I rember how cool and relaxing it felt. I also remember the smell of the water. It had it\'s own unique smell. There was always some kind of wild life becuase it was far in the country. You mostly would see birds and squirrls. It was also a great place to go fishing or kayaking. I remember going as a little girl with my family. My mom would read her books. My dad would fish and my sister and I would swim. Sometimes there would be other people and sometimes we would have the place to ourselves. Even if there were a lot of people everyone almost pretended as if there was no one else there.

It\'s slightly hazy up here, the wind is cool, but I feel free. Free of all my worries and concerns, where I am alone and no one judges me, not even myself. If I came a bit closer to ground, I would see the movement in the fields below, but I just want to fly right now. The sun isn\'t warm on my back, but it\'s comfortable. I am accomplished, proud, and happy with myself because I am above everything, and nothing can touch me. I feel complete, full circle.

Catch me on a bad day and I would be inflicting sunstroke, dehydration, and various cancers on the masses. Why not? After all, the planets revolve around me. Its my gravitational pull that makes the system work and allows the Earth to produce life. If I gave it I can also take it away. But mostly, I would be benevolent and doing my best to ensure bright and sunny days for visiting the beach, camping, etc. In addition, if I were the sun I would look into the problematic issue of drought in certain areas of sub-Saharan Africa. Maybe I can take it easy on them for a while.

The 3 residents are rather intelligent, and moderately diligent.  I don\'t know to what extent I\'m capable of making these judgements, being a wall.  I witness much of the time these 3 young men engaging in the consumption of food, caffeine, nicotine, and cannabis.  From my perspective, that appears to be central to the community life of the living room.  In additionion, it appears to be a place for the academic endeavours of reading, writing, and studying as well as artistic endeavours.  I am not sure how I feel as a wall.  I suppose I feel somewhat unengaged, but I serve a purpose of enclosing and containing.  Supposing that I have the ability of perception, I am a constant witness to mostly dull reality with intriguing and entertaining events and moments.

1392^CC^O^activity6^Im thinking about my kitchen. And im going to take the place of the fridge. I think it would feel very odd to have people stick magnets and pictures on me. I also think it would be odd for people to come regularly and open me up to get what they want. I would also find it strange to not be able to move. My purpose in life would be to sit still and fulfill other peoples needs. But i could take some solace in knowing  that im needed. But i think i would feel very used because... no one shows a refridgerator affection. I dont think being a fridge would lead for a very happy life.

I love watching how people react when i come out. Whether they are happy to see the sun and not the rain or they are irritated because when i appear it means that they will have to wake up soon. I can see all the changes that the world makes between early morning and when everyone is awake. It is so peaceful when i first come out. Almost no one is awake and it\'s so much more quieter. The view from here is so much more different than what i\'m used to.

Or maybe he\'ll get home at a decent hour, brush teeth, change into something comfy, say, sweats and a long-sleeved shirt, some nice puffy socks, and spend a good 8 hours here? You can never tell with this one. Sometimes, my sheets\'ll get changed every week for a good few months.  Other times, I\'ll be wearing the same burgundy fitted sheet for months! That\'s so unsanitary! Or, maybe I\'ll stay as I am now, naked for a good few weeks before he decides to go into the hall closet and pick out a nice, smooth, tight fitted sheet for me.  I love the dark blue one I had over the summer...    I find that he hasn\'t spent much time with me over the last few weeks. I guess it must be the upcoming exams... Not like this summer. He would be lying on top of me for a good 10 hours every night... and sometimes during the day, too! Always alone, though.  Might be nice for him to bring a friend one of these nights. I\'m losing my shape having him sleep on one side every night. I guess when he has more time he can see about meeting a girl...\"    This is what I think my mattress would think if it were animate. In terms of how I would see the world from its perspective:    During the day, the curtains are always closed, so I would see very little daylight. Just a sliver of light coming over the top of the \"curtain\" (really a beach towel). The room is cold, a little damp, and pretty dusty. I think that I need a good dusting, in fact, or a vacuum passed over me. At night, the lights in the room are never on, because \"he\" (me) only uses this room for sleeping. Really, I see very little action, because no one\'s ever in this room except to sleep or to use the computer. And he usually uses the computer at the library. So... I\'m actually very lonely. Most nights this month, he\'s come home really late and falls asleep on the couch instead...

Everyone is very happy and playful. There lots of Neon colours everywhere and the tint is unusual. Its hot out, but not too hot. It\'s a refreshing hot that has a cool wind in the air, its the perfect temperature. There are animals like squirrels, chipmunks, deer and rabbits playing in a nearby forest. There\'s a rainbow in the sky but there is no clouds in sight. There are brightly coloured mushrooms with white polka dots on them.  I can feel my rays of light tickling the people and spots of earth that I meet. Warmth is essential for survival I can feel the pavement heating from my touch. I pass across lips of lovers, and the hats of children. I can feel the plants growing underneath me. THe moisture of the soils below that I cannot reach with my grasp feel cool. I am scattered through the leaves of trees, sometimes making to the earth, other times remaining stuck above a tree top. I know there is happiness. I can penetrate the saddest with my touch. I exude life and love. I am sunshine and happiness.

1501^NR^O^activity6^The park at midnight, in the field. The moon is looking down at the city as every beings to sleep, but there are still some people wondering sround in the park. I illuminate the darkness so that they can see. People lying in the grass looking up and me and the stars, just thinking about anything and everything. I see all of the bad things, but I also see a lot of good things, people are having fun, some people are throwing bottles or smoking, but there really isn\'t anyone around because it\'s too dark even with my light and it\'s too late. But I\'m nocturnal so I don\'t like to go to sleep during the night. There are few cars passing so their lights don\'t last long enough for anyone to see. I can hear dogs bark and see the rain fall. It\'s mostly quite, once in a while there is a shout from one of the people down below. The people on the grass must have seen me for so long they think it\'s almost time for the sun to come out, I have moved from above them to their side. I will likely see these people again, hear what I\'ve heard and continue to to what I do every night, but for now I sleep while everyone else wakes. Until tomorrow night.

There are trees and flowers everywhere. I started walking towards the large outdoor fountain and sat on the ledge. It was so beautiful outside; the moonlight was shinning down and creating wondrous shadows among the plants and trees. I started to take in the perspective of the moon. You would be able to see everything! It would be amazing to always be facing two sides- the universe, and than our own world (Earth). It would be amazing to see all the beautiful surrondings of the planet Earth or even the universe.

They are also talking amongts themselves and multi tasking with other things. I like that I am tall because I can see everything and I also like the fact that i can provide a shade for the kids and anyone else. I like seeing the shadows of the leaves as the sun hits me and my shape reflects on the green grass. I imagine a warm breezy day. There are birds in the sky flying high and singing with the wind. I see the bright blue sky and hot sunny beaming on the kids. It is a nice day.

I would listen in on a conversation of two elderly friends enjoying each other company on a morning promenade through the park.  I might see a homeless person, rest their tried legs.  It is nice how people enjoy a seat like wooden benches so much.  I don\'t think people general love public \"furniture\" but with benches you generally see them being used most of the time.    During the day I would hear the horns and movements from the busy city streets.  But I might also hear birds singing and flying through the air.  I could be covered in leaves or snow, or even rain.  At night I could look around at the dimly lit pathways the crisscross through the park space.  I always enjoy sitting on benches in parks!

You can\'t see the ground or the bushes because the snow is so very deep and high. however, the trees stick out in my mind as still reaching up into the sky. Some birds are flying above the trees on top of the world. I recently was on a plane and I tried to visualize what it would be to fly like a bird. There are snow boundaries or restrictions. You are like the over seeing eye looking down at everything and everyone. Having a perspective like this would bring a large amount of power with it as well.

From the perspective of my mothers mac computer: I sit here on this desk quietly humming, bathing everything in a soft white glow from my monitor. There is a girl infront of me, she is typing away at my keyboard sometimes she stops and looks at me with great frustration. She is in her pajamas, her hair is messy and tucked behind her ears. Another person sometimes enters the room, alternating between showing pride at the good marks the girl has gotten in school and nagging her to get off the computer. The desk that I sit upon is from IKEA it is made of light coloured wood. There are coffee cup stains across its surface. My mouse is being difficult, its trackball won\'t moveits tremendously irritating I feel that he is just being finnicky and doesnt realise that if he doesnt smarten up the people are going to replace him. The girl is still typing away at my keyboard. She seems to be tired, bored and worried. I wonder why she is so irritated. There is a window to my left but all I can see from it is the brick wall of the house next to this one. There is also a catbox to my left I wish it wasnt there. Watching cats relieve themselves isnt as an enjoyable past time as some may think. Sometimes the cat box gets smelly and then the people argue over whose turn it is to clean it. If I could speak i would tell them just to hurry up and cleann the stupid thing cuz its smelly. When the smell is really bad and the people procrastinate for a while over cleaning it I slow down their internet and get glitchy in an attempt to make them want to get off me and clean the stupid catbox but i don\'t think they\'ve realised the connection. :P Sigh this girl in front of me really doesnt seem to be enjoying herself that much oh... she seems to have brightened up slightly maybe she is almost done whatever it is she is doing. She is smiling a bit ah yes she is about to hit the continue button I am glad that she is less sad than before.

If i was this object i would have the opportunity to witness the friwndship and family in the room around me whether we are cuddled by the fire place or even if were watching a movie or sharing some laughs on the carpet. The room is a very calm place with earthly undertones which makes this atmosphere comfortable.

1538^CC^O^activity6^I am a piece of antiquity in a glass showcase. I can no longer function as I once did due to age and fragility but I can be used to teach other generations about the past. People line up to see me and to read the card that explains my existence.. I see school children..wide eyed and willing to learn. I see adults looking for an educational form of entertainment. I see families on vacation..in awe of what is their past too. At night, it gets very quiet as I am left to reflect upon the events of the day. Tomorrow will be pretty much the same.

1537^NR^O^activity6^In my mind I am picturing myself in one of the forests in my neighbourhood as a squirrel. I am able to see many more aspects of the environment because I am constantly climbing trees and other structures which allow me to see things from high levels. I can climb a high tree and appreciate the lovely views of the snow-covered houses, bushes and trees. I can see the tops of peoples\' heads and feel at peace. I would not feel as insignificant because from a higher view I see everything beneath me, even if humans are smarter and control my surroundings. Being able to stay at high levels and run about the neighbourhood would make me feel competent and that I am able to fulfill my needs because I would be working for myself to get my own food and shelter. Contrary to being human, I would be self-sufficient which would bring me great happiness.

1541^NR^O^activity6^Once again I am in my own little garden and I am going to talk about the perpective of a squirrel that has recently decided to visit.    I had for a few days been running around the ground looking for food but it has been quite difficult because the ground is still covered in mounds of snow.  One day I went high up into the tree and spotted many birds flying around in front of me, they were singing and appeared to be very happy.  I decided to investigate the area where they seemed to be finding this happiness.    I sat on the fence for awhile and then noticed the bird feeder, as I was doing this some human knocked on the window, I guess she didn;t want me there.  I was a little apprehensive but the feeling of getting some food easily seemed to give me some strength and I decided I would stay put.  I decided to make my move to the bird feeder, the birds all scattered and this made me feel quite empowered.    I started to eat the seed when that human I had seen before actually came outside.  I jumped to the fence as I had some fear now.  The human came nearer and I moved again but I really didn\'t want to leave my new found \"pantry\" so I decided to stay where I was and see what would happen.  The human had something in her hand, raised it to her eye and a flash happened - I really didn;t know what that was but I really wasn\'t too afraid - I was still on the fence!  The human came closer and I just kept looking at her.  I wondered how long I would have the courage to stay still, the human came closer and my fear became stronger so I moved further along the fence, I still felt I had to keep the feeder in sight, it meant I had easy food - no more scratching on the ground and that was important to me.    The birds had made me feel empowered, and that felt good, I was also thinking that I could face this human too because my hungry for food was so strong

The sun shines through the branches of the tree and the lines that make it through make the snow sparkle. The bark on the tree is dark brown and very rough.  I feel very small and insignificant in this world. Just a tiny part to a bigger picture.

I see the little children just learning to ski, I see the adult beginners, who struggle with more fear than the children, to find their balance, especially as they first learn to get off the ski lift. I see how the snow glistens in the sunlight and how it takes a different look with the shadows cast from the nighttime lights. From my perspective, I can see the long patterns the skiers carve in the snow, a record of their struggles and accomplishments. I see how afraid they get as they start to come closer to me and my tree siblings, fearful they might not turn in time and come crashing into me. I also notice that is really the only time they pay attention to me, too caught up in the struggle of learning to ski to look up and see my branches.

Although Christmas was a while ago, I convinced my family to leave our Christmas tree up until the end of February because it is so relaxing to sit in front of it.  Therefore, I decided to take the perspective of the Christmas tree.  As a round Christmas tree that brushes the ceiling of my family room, I would have quite a view of the rest of the room.  Also, because I have lights all over me I would be able to see the rest of the room through different colored lights.  I think I would feel great as a Christmas tree because I am decorated festively and am the focal point of the room.  People also sit and stare at me adoringly because I make them happy!

There is a fun fair at Clarence Pier and I can see and hear the people enjoying the rides. I can also see the hovercraft taking passengers across the Solent from Southsea to the Isle of Wight. I feel comforted and at peace knowing I am home - the place of my birth.

1565^NR^O^activity6^I transported myself to the hills on the farm about half an hour away from my house, as a tree. The views from the ground on these hills is amazing enough, so the view as a tree would be even better. I\'d be subjected to the harshest of environmental elements as the hills are pretty exposed and the trees on them few. This is also a positive though, as there would be few things to block my view. Most of the time there would be a slight wind blowing, sometimes a gale, but this makes the view clear. When it is a still day you can not see as far. From the hill I\'d be able to keep an eye on my nan and pa\'s farm, and my uncle and aunty who live just up the road. My immediate surroundings on the hill are not too picturesque, lots of rocks, numerous fallen down trees, and sheep trails. Sheep are not often seen up there, and its more likely on a hot day to find snakes. Im really scared of snakes and being the tree I wouldnt be able to move/run away but I guess that wouldn\'t matter as trees cant get bitten. At nightime heaps of kangaroos would come out and litter the ground with kangaroo poo. When the mine is in operation thered be noise, but otherwise the only sound would be the infrequent cars coming up the road, sheep in the distance, and the wind rustling in the leaves. It would be a very peaceful existence

1601^NR^O^activity6^I\'ve been travelling like this for as long as I can remember, longer really as the consciousness of what I am only began after I\'d left the great water. There, the world was full of swirling tides and upheavals, creatures of every size from ones which barely made a ripple to those who caused whirlpools. Then, little by little, I began to move downwards, become separate, spread, hidden until with much of the other water I came to a new place. My nature had changed and instead of moving as a body, I was one of a myriad tiny parts, independent and vulnerable to the elements.     I had lost my bite too, had become milder and when I joined with the others, I found different animals lived in and with us.  Not the huge, fierce things we\'d had in great water but smaller.  They were no less determined though, driven by some force different from mine but nevertheless as strong.  For a long time I was in darkness, even after I joined with the others, then something happened which reminded me of my life before.  I came out into the light.  Part of great water had been in the light and the colours had been magnificent, darting yellow and piercing blue.  The colours in new water weren\'t quite so marvellous but when the light shone through me I felt alive and vital, able to do anything, go anywhere.  I was faster too, rushing between stones and down valleys, chasing the animals which jumped joyously all around me.  Sometimes I was deep and green and quiet and it was then I felt dangerous, as if waiting for the unwary. Othertimes I felt light and bubbly, without a care in the world.  I have no idea where I\'m going, though some of the creatures who live with me tell me about a great water that they came from and it sounds very like my own beginnings but I cannot imagine I will ever see that again.  I\'ve changed, everything has changed and there is no way back. Everything about me moves forward, so how can I get back to great water?  I don\'t need to. There\'s no longing in me to return, this headlong rush to wherever, is exhilerating and every new bend and twist brings me something new. I like the light best but sometimes I go into the ground and become deep and quiet for a while. That\'s fine too, it\'s restful and prepares me for the time when I may emerge as a cascade or falls.  That\'s the bit I like best, thundering over a cliff, leaping, diving, hurtling downwards to become laughing foam and roiling strids.  But just now I\'m taking it easy, sliding through woodland, hiding under banks, peeping our from beneath willows, taking my ease. Tomorrow I may be a torrent or a flood or I may lose my strength and become part of the land. Who knows? Life is always exciting, always new.

1543^NR^O^activity6^I am a tree. I can\'t move much so I am totally dependent on my needs coming to me for my survival. I have to tolerate everything that comes my way. I could be bitter about all the indignitities I have to endure, like birds crapping on me or people pulling my branches off or carving their names in my trunk. I find it easier to just take it all without complaint though because there\'s nothing much I can do about it.     I get really thirsty and hungry sometimes because the rain doesn\'t come regularly and sometimes the soil becomes depleted. Sometimes there\'s too much rain or run off and I feel like I\'m going to drown.     Every fall I have to prepare for the coming cold by drawing my energy into my core and shedding my leaves. Winter\'s are the toughest to get through but thankfully I am well equipped to survive and I can feel good that I can provide some shelter and food for other creatures.    I look forward to the lenghtening days of spring and really enjoy the warm sun on my newly forming leaves. I love seeing all the new life spring forth.

They can eat by the light that comes from within me.    The slight chill of the early evening air outside is diminished completely by warmth that I emanate outward to the people, dog, and delightful cabin itself.  It gives me great joy to bring the comfort of light and warmth to the world.

1657^NR^O^activity6^I\'m some small mammal, something nomadic and self-sufficient.  I\'m tough, swarthy and hairy, but with a turn of speed and a solid constitution.  All I do, day in and day out, is wander, explore, discover.  I explore the area around where I am for weeks, until I know it backwards.  Then I start branching out, wandering in whichever direction takes my fancy.  I know I can live wherever I am, I can find food, build myself some shelter and be safe, so I have no concerns, just a constant desire to discover everything around me.  I can climb trees to see for great distances, I can handle rocky areas, I can swim across rivers and lakes; I can make basic tools to fiddle with.  I can\'t fly, but I don\'t want to, because that would be too much like cheating.  I want to discover the world piece by piece by walking it, not by scaling the heights and just mapping the whole place just like that.  When it\'s windy I feel the wind running through my hair.  When it\'s raining I feel the water washing over me, refreshing.  When it\'s too sunny I search out a place that\'s sheltered and just relax.  I sometimes meet others.  We sometimes wander together, and sometimes we just say hi and go our separate ways.  I feel very calm, purposeful but relaxed.

The actual shelf part is made of a honey color wood that is supported by the ribbon. On that shelf is a blue and white clown that my grandmother made. it has moveable limbs so that it is sitting with it\'s legs crossed. it is quite old and no longer sits up straight, so from that height it appears to be looking down at me. When I was smaller I was nervous about the clown looking at me. It does have a pleasing appearence, but as a child I was nervous about it, cause it\'s eyes seemed to follow me around the room. Now as an adult, I am no longer nervous, I have good memories about playing with that clown. There are no longer feelings of nervousness, just pleasent memories.

From this perspective I can see people going about their daily lives, eating their meals, getting ready for work and leaving the house, returning home at the end of the day and looking to relax or get ready for the next activity. I see the house, in a state of disarray at times, as folks are too busy to pickup or tidy-up; other times I watch as folks take time to clean and put things away. Usually every morning  I get picked up and read as someone does a daily devotional. Every Sunday evening I am brought to the living room to follow along with sermon watched on TV. Sometimes, there\'s an occasional evening when I\'m picked up to follow along with a preacher on TV. Every Tuesday evening I\'m packed up and taken to a bible study at the pastor\'s home. There, I am often read, through different passages, and shared with others and then there\'s much discussion about what\'s in my pages and how it\'s relative to individuals.  Once in awhile, if someone has some \"spare time\" or is having a hard time with something, I\'ll get picked up and referenced in between these regular reading intervals. I am turned to for advice; I am referenced for things that have been noted or circled in my pages. I am looked to for comfort at these times.  I am used much more than I used to be. Several years ago I wouldn\'t have been read as often or written in or shared. I have become an important part of this family\'s life.

1667^NR^O^activity6^I look down and can see people standing and sweating. Some of them are shielding their heads because I am so strong. There are white chairs too and people are sitting on them, and they are all looking ahead as something big and white circles something that looks white and black. These are only shadows though, because a big white cloth is hiding them from me. The cloth is being held on four sides with flowers circling up and up and up to the cloth. There are other flowers too, that people picked and arranged in funny ways as they liked them. Red flowers and pink flowers and white flowers. The sky surrounding me is so blue, even though it is starting to get late here and I will be going away. There are birds singing  and there are some tress around and this strange view of brown walls people seem to be staring at. There are women all wearing the same color red dress - they must be hot in it but they don\'t seem to mind, and there are well dressed women weeping the white spot and darker spot look like they are floating up to me with joy. There are more flowers on tables and funny colors and people are covered in some heavy cloths considering how strong I am. Now there is noise and people are dancing, and the women is in white and the man is in black and a crowd of people are scaring the birds away as theya re ecorted away from my sight.
