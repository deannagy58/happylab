Shaking with rage, she hissed that he is going to be punished.     He flew through the aisles of the store, looking for a product.     The young girl was clawing at her mother\'s neck, enthralled by the necklace she was wearing.     He had to use the washroom so badly that he waddled to the cubicle.     The crow buzzed with excitement.     The two adolescent girls twittered mindlessly over the magazine cover.     The little boy stomped in anger.     His voice dry, he couldn\'t help but croak the answer.    The woman was startled at the man\'s tone, and in spite of herself, squeaked her reply.     In much better spirits, she hopped to her next class.

1133^NR^O^activity7^Singing sweetly is often used when describing how people sing, referring to how birds sing. Also, being like an elephant in a china shop, being extremely loud like an elephant would be if they were in a china shop. People also say listen to her purr, when referring to the noise of a nice car, referring to a cat who purrs when they are relaxed, calm or sleeping. Also, laughing like a hyena, referring to the comical and joyful lives of hyenas. Also, scurrying away or about, referencing mice or scurry when they are trying to get away and run or walk. When people say they pounced on that, referencing lions who are attacking their prey or are playfighting, meaning that they didn\'t wait very long but rather quickly went for it. As the example said, when people how with laughter, referring to dogs and wolves.

However, when exams aren\'t all I\'m thinking about I usually keep my room pretty darn tidy. For a dorm room it is quite big but that just might be because I am the only one who lives here. My room is very colourful because I have a lot of pictures hanging on the walls and my room is also painted two different colours. I love my room because it\'s my home away from y actual home and I have done everything possible in order to make it feel very homey by hanging up pictures from the magazines and also photos that I have taken.

It adds to the many smells of the kitchen. The house is divided into three floors. the main ground floor is where most of the activity takes place. The floors are hardwood and indicate high traffic prints. The furnishings on the main floor are contempary and simple in design. The dining table and chairs are a matching set. The living room also has a white matching sofa set. Hits of colour pop up here and there in little details. Most of the place loooks like a blank canvas.

1198^CC^O^activity7^I think the first word that has come to everyone\'s mind when they saw our apartment is \"cozy\". Recently I reorganized the apartment and bought new furniture (lamps, coffee tables) and the apartment looks very cozy. It is also calm and welcoming and since its always neat and tidy it makes a person want to relax, do homework, read watch a movie etc in the living room. Our kitchen would be organized. Everything is neatly put away in the correct shelves and things are always where they are suppose to be after I do my weekly cleanings. MY room would be classy, cozy and feminine at the same time. I have a floor lamp which gives off nice light towards the center of the room. I think my apartment is also clean, welcoming, sophisticated, well kept, warm, inviting, a social area, a relaxing area and just very much like home.

The vibe i get when i walk into the house is very warm and inviting with all of the decor she has equipped each room with. The living room is one of the more spacious rooms in the house which includes cream coloured draped that are flowy and bring a softness to the lighting in the room, which is most always dimmed. The kitchen is a solid dark navy, which matches the accessorized placematts and table cloth.     The basement is:  -moderately sized  -usually cold  -newly furnished  -antique looking  -cozy

This room contrasts the feeling of my basement. The basement feels cold and secluded. Darkness appears because of the lack of light, and a feeling of wet dampness. Their are many smaller rooms within the basement which contrasts the open spatius feeling of the main room. The kitchen is a place of business, and quickness,you go their to eat, or make food.

I \"chirp\" when I am excited, and people have often said that nagging is \"chirpping\" too. Makes me think of a bird    When people get angry, they bear their \"fangs\" which reminds me of a bat.     When things get crazy, the word \"hairy\" comes to mind.  This makes me think of any furry animal    When women fight, it is a \"cat fight\" or they bring out their \"claws\"    Crazy like a \"fox\" comes to mind when referring to someone who is smart or clever.    \"Playful as a kitten\" comes to mind when referring to someone who has a playful nature.    The term \"flighty\" is referred to when someone is not stable, which makes me think of a bird too.    The term \"peckish\", used to describe being hungry, makes me think of a wood pecker.    That\'s all that is coming to mind for now!

1250^CC^O^activity7^The inside of my home can only be described as a university house.  There is no dishwasher, and thus there is dishes everywhere on a continuous basis.  Our dishes are a collection of old dishes from our families.  It is an old house, filled with hand-me down furniture so nothing matches. My room is my haven from the rest of the house.  Although my window has a rather large draft, it is where I spend the most of my time.  The walls are beige throughout the house, because the landlord recently paided the entire house before we moved in.  So in my room I have added personal touches mostly of colour to my room to make my room feel less like a sterile hospital and more like my own personal space.

At times depressing but with a beautiful appearance as well. The basement is lively, filled with joy and noise. it is bright and fun. The kitchen is small, dull, but has a lively smell of cooking. My bedroom is is filled with a lot of space a with few things in there, however, it is messy. My sisters room are mostly cluttered, messy at times. My parents room is has the same feeling as the living room. The bathroom has the same feeling as the kitchen but of opposite smell.

1194^CC^O^activity7^Upon entering the house from the front door (that most guests use - our home has a warm feeling.  The decor that composes the front entrance is calm and soothing.  If a person is using the entrance that occupants of the home use, they enter through the garage.  The decor from this perspective is bland and is not as docorated.  This entrance is mainly a \"functional entrance\" and thus, has not a lot of emphasis on posh - although, one might like it to be.  Both entrances meet at the same spot - a hall way.  This hall way leads the individual into the kitchen.  The hallway is made from dark cherry stained hard wood.  This hard would has a matte finish and isn\'t as glossy as some others.  To the right of the hallway is the stair case that leads to the bedrooms up stairs.  This space is an open concept and is bright and inviting because of the sky light.  The sky light allows a lot of light to fill all of the space which allows a warm feeling upon entrance.  The kitchen is cold due to its tile floor.  It is mixed with an 80\'s style cabinet set with modern furnishes.  The living room, oposite to the kitchen, has comfortable furniture that is based around the concept of livibility.  Everything is functional.  Although it has eye appeal, it is clearly a statement of comfort.  When a perosn enters into this space, there is much temptation to flop down on one of the comfy looking chairs.

1501^NR^O^activity7^I am not sure how many words there are for animal sounds, but I\'ve some up with a list that I think will suffice. Many people use the words growl fro people when they are saying something angrily or harsh. It\'s generally attributed to males, while females are associated to with the word hiss when they are ridiculing someone. Both of these words are attributed to traits that are usually are angry. As well as the word roar. When someone is angry, they are roaring, or in other words, yelling at something or someone. But roaring words, people don\'t actually hiss, or roar, it\'s a descriptive word used to describe the feeling behind the saying. Someone who barks at another or snarls at another is usually also used unpleasantly. Some people can refer to another person as a quack meaning they are a fake or suspicious. People also patn, just as a dog does when they are exhausted, or out of breath, the word pant is used for both people and animals, but a dog pants to cool down, a person pants to catch their breath. I don\'t think people meow, or moo, maybe if those terms are used in a demeaning way, otherwise they are often used to describe people. A bird pecks, but a peck for a human is associated with a kiss, not a an attack, like a bird would peck for.

Also to \"squirrel something away\" means to hide it away as squirrels and other animals store food for the winter.   when someone \"barks\" something at you, as if to say that they\'re giving an abrupt answer, usually considered to be rude or blunt.  in the same way, when someone \"snarls\" at you its usually referencing someone\'s snide remark.  im sure ive heard someone use the phrase \"trot around\" before.  when my sister was in the first grade, her teacher told her that she chews like \"a cow chewing its cudd\" which is an incredibly rude and awful thing to say to a little girl. I\'m not sure if that counts or not.  when someone \"hisses\" something at you, is an example of a sound a cat would make. someone could \"squeak\" something, refering to a mouse. some of these i havent heard people say but im sure ive read them in books along the years.

1546^CC^O^activity7^I would describe my home as light, airy and spacious.  All of the rooms in my house, with the exception of my basement and one washroom, have large windows and, therefore, lots of sunlight shines into my house making it very cheerful and pleasant.  All the walls in my house are white, which I think makes the rooms feel large and cheerful.  I would say that different rooms in my house have different personalities.  For example, the basement is older (it hasn’t been renovated in a while) and is dark compared to the rest of the house.  In addition, most of the rooms in my house, apart from the basement, have beautiful views of nature. I would describe my basement as dark, gloomy, depressing and out of date.  On the other hand, I find the rest of my house cozy and relaxing to be in. While the kitchen has a cozy country feel to it, the rest of the house is more formal and has European influences (part of my family is from Western Europe).
