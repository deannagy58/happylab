Sometimes they are very loving and seek attention. It is like me in that sometimes it needs to be with people but a lot of time it needs to be alone - I get annoyed/stressed being around too many people for too long.

1130^CC^O^activity5^I am going to write about mark darcy. He is a character in Brigdet jones diary. His character is based on the character from Jane Austen pride and prejudice.     he is my dream man, in both stories, but moslty in Brigdet Jones version.     He has a strong personaily, a atractive one. He is hard working, proper, reserved, and has a sence of humor, but it is also reserved. I like his character becasue he is just perfect.     He is simalr to me in some ways. I am reserved, and proper, and I am also english. It is hard to say how much I am like this person.     He is an active person, and very social, I am active and social, but I like dinner parties and calm things, as does Mark.     In the story, it never shows you were he lives. So it is my beleife that he lives alone.     This person makes me feel like I should wait and meet a man like this. He is so wonderful, but maybe there is really no one like that out there, or maybe i am in the wrong country to meet someoen like that as he is very English.

1093^NR^O^activity5^I think about animals all the time as I work in animal welfare.  I think often about elephants.  African elephants live mostly in the middle and southern parts of the continent of Africa.  I admire these animals because they are beautiful and because of their interesting and complex lives.  I believe that we are fortunate to share our world with all animals.  Elephants live in herds lead by matriarchies.  This is different from humans that have mostly been lead by men.  I believe that elephants do have different personalities - not because I have ever met one but from books I have read and documentaries I have seen.  Some elephants are shy, some are domineering, some are protective.  They also seem to have a great memory and have acted out violently towards people (and why shouldn\'t they) Elephtants are like humans in many ways.  They are social and generally live in groups, with the exception of young males.  They walk together, eat together and interact with each other.  Elephants that I have read about or seen in documentaries have intense grieving processes when an elephant in their family has died.  Elephants play with each other, particularly in the water.  They help raise the young.  Elephants walk great distances.  They need a great deal of space.  There habitat would consist of anywhere they could walk to - forests, savanna, etc.   They eat fruits, leaves, roots and tree bark.    When elephants interact with people it is generally not good.  African elephants are wary of humans however they come into conflict when they eat from human farms and gardens.  Their habitat is at risk and African elephants are threatened.  They are killed for their ivory.  watchin poachers kill their family members must be terrifying and stressful.  I feel happy thinking that I share the earth with elephants however, I often think of their plight and acknowedge that their soon may not elephants.  I think about this often and it makes me very sad.

She is always happy no matter what, she always wants to say hello, she kinda talks when you walk in. She definitely has a personality. A very sassy personality for sure. It\'s sort\'ve like mine in ways, but my life for sure isn\'t as relaxing. It lives with me and my dad and our other dog tia. And in the summer with my sister, her boyfriend, and their two cats. When my dad gets married it will be the whole family, his wife, her three dogs and a lizard. She eats dog kibble.  She lives in our house, with a huge backyard that she can chase squirrels in. She gets along great with everybody. She is a bit ADD so she isn\'t allowed to play without a leash if she is anywhere other than the backyard. I love my dog and she is very loving and caring.

I know everyone says that about their pet, or exaggerate when talking about them, but in all honesty, I feel like it\'s a completely true statement. She\'s a black cat splashed with white on her paws, and around her mouth. Her eyes are always wide, like she\'s understanding. It would seem this is true. She\'s so affectionate, and no matter what, it\'s as though she senses when someone is in low spirits. This is a common trait in most cats, but it\'s intensely so with Harriet. Never is she aggressive or angry. She truly is amazing, and I miss her so.

1133^NR^O^activity5^I personally think that giraffes are extremely interesting animals. I find them interesting because they are so different from any other animal who live in the same location as it does. I find it extremely interesting and intriguing how their necks are so long and how they are so tall and skinny compared to other animals. I also admire the pattern on their bodies and their coloring. This makes them such a beautiful animal. When thinking of this animal I believe that it is somewhat shy and a timid animal but once they are familiar wtih other animals or areas around them they are less shy. In that sense, giraffes are like me as in the beginning I am also shy but open up more the more familiar and comfortable I become. They live with other giraffes, and often it appears that they have their own families in which they live with. Giraffes eat leaves and folliage.Giraffes live in the wild as they are not pets. They interact well with others of their kind, however upon interaction with people they are a little more timid as they are afraid that we will do harm to them. I personally like this animal because I just find it extremely interesting and just am intrigued as it is so different from any other animal.

1090^CC^O^activity5^I find Raskolnikov from Crime and Punishment an interesting fictional character.  He is lonley, is disillusioned by his ideological views of the world, and lives in his self-made \"reality\".  His personality is unclear as much of the novel has Raskolnikov trying to escape his actions and past.  He encompasses a split personality of extreme wrong doing while trying to portray a righteous man.  He is terrorized by his inner conflict of what he wants and what is unfolding in his life.  I find this somewhat similar to myself trying to escape past behaviours and trying to re-define myself while faced with opposition from my family.  Raskolnikov eats very poorly as he is destitute.  He is also a school drop out - as I was before I transfered schools.  I took time off school as I felt forced into it initially and was being forced into things by the school that I didn\'t think was right.  After this, like Raskolnikov, I secluded myself in Acton and later in Europe.  Raskolnikov lives a solitary life and does not let people, his family or lover Sonia into his life.  Raskolnikov is one who is touched by depression and has coma like states. He makes me feel like an inner conflict is one that many may suffer from.  Raskolnikov does not ultimately let anyone get to know his true inner self, and I feel like this, for him, may not be a choice but something that he does not know how to accomplish.

1144^CC^O^activity5^I think \"Blondie\", played by Clint Eastwood, from \"The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly\" is the most interesting character I can think of.  His most admirable attributes are his determination and self-sufficiency.  He\'s portrayed as a solitary figure (he\'s not given a back story at all), and director Sergio Leone lets his, along with the other characters\' actions to speak for themselves.  Since he\'s shown as a mostly solitary figure, he\'s different from myself because I\'m usually around either family or friends a lot of the time.  However, he doesn\'t speak much at all in the film, and I see myself as someone who doesn\'t speak without a reason.  He is shown without having a home, and most of his interactions are with the other two main characters in their quest for treasure.  However, one poignant scene is his interaction with a wounded Civil War soldier.  He gives him water and covers him with a jacket (I think) before he dies.    I guess the only way I could describe the way he makes me feel is...tough.  He\'s a tough guy, a man\'s man, and he kind of makes you want to be tough as well.

1209^NR^O^activity5^The animal that I think is most interesting is the tiger. The thing that interests me is that even though the common myth of the lion is that it is the strongest of the animals (thus the alias of being the \"king\"), in reality, the tiger is a much more dangerous animal.  Although the tiger and I don\'t have any similar characteristics, some people would say that there can be somewhat a connection that can be made.  If the tiger actually gave a \"poop\" about being the king of animals, I\'m pretty sure that the tigers would start a coup in the animal kingdom and successfully usurp the throne of \"king.\" It would simpily be the fact that they really don\'t care...  Honestly speaking, I\'m the same. I never gave a \"poop\" either about who is superior to me when it came to grades and such, because that really don\'t interest me. In high school, I never cared for school work and (and I\'m being totally honest) I focused more on playing and having fun then focusing on my grades.  If someone got an A through intense studying and I get a C, I really couldn\'t care less because it never intersted me...    Enough of the similarities... Now about the tiger...  First of all, tigers (I think) lives with its kind (depending what kind of tiger, African or Indian, etc) and it eats the raw flesh of animals and lives in the wild hunting for prey. Does it interact with people? Only if it\'s hungry...

Although he is a fictional character, he complies with all the instruments of a man any woman would probably want. He\'s strong, romantic, sly, smooth and handsome. This image could heighten standards for women by making all men look up to a type of person who has a wide variety of skills. Although these skills are mostly fictional, the idea is still nonfiction.

He knows that at 8 in the monring the whole family is going to pile out and he is going to be alone for the day, but that we will come home after school/work and he is there in the front room to greet us. I would definitely say that my dog has personality. He can be in a play full mood, where he just runs in circles or plays with my cat, he can be sleepy, cuddly, he doesnt usually get angry/mad/aggressive which is one of his best qualities. I would say that me and harry dont have the same personalities, because if you push my buttons there is going to be a repercussion, but with my dog...you can poke him...pick him up....make him do tricks and he doesnt ever seem to be angry. Harry eats dog food as his main food alothugh he tends to be fed a lot of human food. He lives in my house, he goes on three walks a day to the park so he can get rid of his energy and get some exercise.Harry is very playful with other dogs and gets along well with most dogs although so big dogs scare him. He interacts very will with people, he greets everyone who comes to my house, and he is even gentle enough to play with babies. I love my dog and he makes me feel great

I would say that she is probably lonely, but too self centered to reach out to others. Adversely, she is a hero and saves people from harm. She lives somewhat of a duel life in this sense. This makes her quite interesting in my eyes. I would imagine she could eat just about anything and since she is a teen is probably eats a lont of junk food. She is on the cheerleading team for the sake of fitting in yet has no friends. I find this confusing. People seem to be attracted to her personality even though she is rather introverted.

He does liv in a building, and he interacts with people every day , he can be nice or very, very mean.

I would say that my dog has a personality that is very much like mine. My mom always use to joke and say that I was making the dog lazy by letting her just lay around with me all day and carrying her around everywhere. My dog lives a pretty isolated life from other animals because she is the only pet that we have. I do not think she really knows how to react to other animals because when other animals are around she gets very jealous.

Kiera makes me feel very happy, she is always there when i am sad or lonely and appreciates everything that i do for her. she is like my child.

I\'ve come to the conclusion that chickens on their own don\'t think but as a group mind they can formulate a thought  or possibly two, although not at the same time...this is a gross generalization, of course, in my many years of relating to chickens and chicken dinners i have met the odd bird that approaches the consciousness level of say, a conservative cabinet minister, and that\'s actually another great thing about chickens is that they make me laugh when i see humans acting like chickens and especially when they act like Roosters...anyways, getting off topic slightly here...seriously now, my chickens were the first chickens to be raised in these parts on organic grain and they are some kind of delicious...we\'ve had the same steady customers for 25 years and some of these folks are allergic to the twentieth century,...they run around in the field in big boxes we call tractors that get pulled forward to fresh pasture when they finish eating the stuff they\'re parked on...they get their organic grain as well, of course and typically get killed at 5-8 pounds although we\'ve raised them as big as 12 pounds just to embarass

This person is powerful and solitary, haunted by his past but is out to protect the innocent. He is plagued by guilt and longing for his love that he cannot have. He is pessimistic but does what he has to do. His personality is similar in some ways but not all. He is a truly good person but lacks confidence in his abilities. He lives alone in the alleys amung the homeless but keeps to himself, only appearing when he is drawn out. He does not seem to have a \"home\", he is more of a creature than a person. He does interact with people sometimes. He puts up a front at first but eventually if you keep at it, he will open up.

I admire the fact that they live in such cold weather and that their partners are gone for multiple months at a time and they still manage to live peacefully. I think penguins are happy and almost childlike in a way, because they seem slightly caricatured. I think in some ways, they are similar to me, because they are not aggressive at all and they are often very focused on certain tasks. Words that could be used to describe them that are similar to how I could be described are playful, positive, and curious. Penguins usually live in groups together, it is safer because alone, they are easy prey. They eat fish, and  live in the antarctic in the ice and snow. Unless they are in captivity, penguins don\'t often have to interact with people. These animals make me feel interested in exploring the world, and leaning more about what is out there.

She owns her own fashion line and magazine. The things that I admire about her are the fact that she is a strong independent woman, who can do things for herself. She never has to rely on anyone, but if she needed to she has many close friends who she can turn to. She has never been the person who bites their tongue, she\'s not afraid to say what she\'s feeling and in that way no one ever takes afvantage of her or walks all over her. I also admire that, even after all the fame and success she has accomplished, she hasn\'t lost sight of what\'s really important in life. She still cares about the little things and wants to use her success to help others. For example, in the show, she fosters infants from other countries who are flown over to America for life saving surgeries, and then helps them after their surgery is over. When they are healthy again she gives them back to their parents. I think that our personalities have some similarities, but are also vastly different. They are similar in the way that I want to help others when I can too. I sponsor a child in Honduras, by giving money monthly, for medecine, school supplies, food, etc. But the things that are different about our personalities are the fact that I am quite and not out spoken, I am careful about what I say and when I say it. This person lives her life interacting with many people, friends and family. She lives in a very nice house, with a teenager that she is fostering. This person makes me feel like one person can make a difference in the world. This character is really inspirational.

She lives with my family and I, and with a dog, so she is never alone. The kind of food that she eats is her dry cat food, and we give her treats on a regular basis as well. She lives in our house with us, and is not an outdoor cat. She used to live in an apartment with my best friend, her cat and I, and the two cats grew up together and got along really well. She interacts with people on a regular basis and loves attention. She makes me feel happy because she\'s very affectionate with me and is always doing something that makes me laugh.

1186^CC^O^activity5^I\'m thinking of the Joker, from the Batman series of comic books.  I\'m not quite sure why I picked him. I guess I\'ve always been fascinated by his ability to remain cool under pressure, while still having every part of his master plan laid out. To me, he seems more clown-esque than an actual villain. He\'s almost like a little boy who\'s just trying to make the world laugh at his jokes, without realizing he\'s hurting people.  The Joker has a white face, green hair and outlandish outfits. He\'s not the psycho killer that many make him out to be, though.  His personality is almost entirely different from mine. I don\'t have any master plans, I crack under pressure and I often just freak out when I\'m in unfamiliar situations.  A word that could be used to describe us both is \'ambitious\'. We\'re both after what will best benefit us, long term.    The Joker is a lone wolf, similar to me. He trusts nobody and does all his planning himself. He has no fixed diet or home. He harms, maims and sometimes kills all the people he meets, which, I guess, isn\'t very optimistic.    The Joker makes me feel like I\'m not a total screw-up, because I know that, even if it\'s in a fictional world, there are more twisted people than me.

1098^CC^O^activity5^ Today I watched a documentary on an individual, whose name I cannot remember, who was the leader of a cult. He had very few followers and was actually ostracized an forced to move from one city to the next a few times because of the negative attention he received from other town members. However the 10 or so individuals who did follow him where completely enthralled with him, so much so that he was able to convince them he was a prophet and have the members kill an entire family that was in the cult, including 3 children, one as young as six. This man\'s personality is extremely different from mine, on nearly every level. He was abusive, negative, and could probably be deemed psychotic. Yet at the same time, he gained the respect of his cult followers by his ability to memorize the Bible and the book of Mormon. Obviously very bright, he was able to control those who let themselves be close to them.  Although I see nothing commendable about this individual, I do find him extremely interesting.

Like me they are determined and focused, when need be. They live with others. They eat a variety of foods. They live in the city. They live in a building. This person interacts with others well, very business like. This person makes me feel inspired.

1284^CC^O^activity5^The person that I find interesting is Edward from the novel Twilight. The thing that I admire about him is that even though he is a vampire he is capable of being such a special guy and fall in love with a girl who tests him so much. He can kill her so quick but he is gentle and loving to her. Edward\'s characteristics are that he is a vampire but a good one who doesn\'t drink human blood but only the blood of animals. His personality is that he plays the piano, likes to learn and is adventurous and shows Bella(the girl he is in love with)very interesting things. I think that I am adventurous as well and I care about things deeply sometimes and that is something that makes us similar. Edward lives with vampires that are also like him in the fact that they try not to drink human blood, and they live in the forest in a big and gorgeously designed house. The family of vampires don\'t interact much with other people other than the people they live with because of the consequences. Edward is a perfect gentleman and he makes you feel like your boyfriend is garbage and that you want someone like him to love you.

This person has a very anti-hero yet honorable personality. Their personality is similar to mine. Words that can describe our personalities include quiet and funny. They sometimes live a solitary life and sometimes with other people. They eat normal food but probably a lot more meat. They sometimes live in buildings. They interact with others by using their mutant abilities. This person makes me feel pretty awesome.

1262^CC^O^activity5^The fictional character who I think is interesting is Rebecca Bloomwood from the Shopaholic book series.  I think Rebecca has a very telling story about her life,she is thousands and thousands of dollars in debt thanks to her overwhelmingly huge shopping addiction. Her life seems to be very busy, with lots of adventures and run-ins with people you wouldn\'t expect. My personality compared to Becky\'s is in some way similar I suppose, we are both very energetic and like to shop! I can only think that if I were to get a mastercard, I would find myself in Becky\'s debt pool immediatley..hense why I try to steer clear of getting one! Becky is also very passionate about her job, and takes pride in doing it well. I have also tried to be the best I can be at my work, and feel that in that way, Becky and I are similar.Becky lives with her flatmate,but eventually, her roomate moves out and Becky is alone ( if i rememeber correctly..) For the most part though, Becky is a people person and always finds herself interacting with others when she is happiest.  Becky lives in a beautiful London flat with she can certainly not afford. She rarely makes her own meals, and will go out to some of the most posh cafes and eateries to grab a bite. THis of course is a big reason for her debt.  The shopaholic series is a promising book for those who want an easy, fun and sink into the couch, read. Rebecca\'s character is just so spontaneous, never know what situation she will land in next, and I personally love being taken along for the ride.

Serena is very determined and that reminds me of myself.  Serena\'s has a personality that anyone would want, she is nice, cheerful, energetic, funny, etc.  Serena lives her life with many people surrounding her, including her friends and family.  Unlike me, Serena lives in New York in a very expensive building with her family.  Whenever I watch Gossip Girl it makes me feel good because there are always things that Serena has to overcome that are similar to things in my life that I have to overcome.

They are very smelly and howl a lot at random things. They are pretty lazy btu when they are energized they are so beautiful and fun to be around. Their personality is nothing like mine except when they are hyper they bounce around and go crazy like me. But they sleep most of there days and I do not. They beg for food - which I don\'t as well. They eat dog food but in my dogs case they mostely eat cat food. They live in people\'s homes. It lives in the house to keep warm but it sleeps in a cage. This animal makes me happy because they are just so soft and warm all the time.

1287^NR^O^activity5^golden retriever is a good choice for pets. This is a kind of big bred. He is clever, warm and kind with children. Different dogs really have different personalities. Many dogs will be mad if you disturb him when he is sleeping, and many dogs will angry if you touch him when he is eating. People usually give some dry food for golden retriever, but sometimes people will also give some people\'s food such as rice with meat to him.I really like this kind of dogs because i have one golden retriever before. This kind of dog is so cute, and he always has him own ideas to everything. It is amazing.

She is confident in herself, and is not afraid to let her true colours shine. She is very interested in animals and music, which shows that she has interests. Her personality is very bubbly, and i think that this is a good trait to have. We have similar qualities such as, an interest in the environment and music. She lives with her friends, which is a good thing because she is surrounding herself with people who she loves, and who love her. She lives in New York City and is a vegetarian. I think that that is a very good characteristic. She makes me laugh, and generally puts me in a good mood. She is sometimes awkward with others, but can always put a smile on thir face.

After she had fallen in love with one of her patients, he had complications with a heart transplant and died. She did not know that he was a millionaire and she inhereted 8.7 million dollars. She donated all of the money to help patients in the hospital, even though her friends were pressuring her to deposit the money and use it on herself because she \"deserved it\". She knew that the money should be put toward something meaningful. She is similar to me because although she may be stubborn at times, she puts others before herself.

1242^CC^O^activity5^alright. I am thinking of the phantom of the opera, the way he was depicted in the 2004 motion picture! he\'s a pretty well built man, who lives underneath the opera house in paris, france in the late 19th and early 20th century. The left side of his face is hideously deformed. When he was a child, he was shown off at the circus as a \'devils child\' and escaped by strangling his \'owner\'. Until then his head was covered in a burlap bag with holes for the eyes. Afterwards, the phantom started covering the left side of his face with a glass or ivory mask, with a hole for his eye. The mask, though didn\'t cover the left part of his mouth; it left his whole mouth open to the world. The phantom has a fairly medium-toned skin colour and brown eyes (i think). As well, he always wears his hear gelled back, no hair ever covers his face. As i said before, he is very well built and very much in shape. The thing i admire about him the most is his musical talent. He is a musical genius; he writes whole plays (musicals) and the score for each. He\'s also a magician for that matter. Being incredibly into music myself, I admire his talent to write all these amazing musical numbers all the time. It\'s hard to actually describe his personality, as all we really see by watching the movie are his desires. I guess he\'s very protective of Christine, and of his face, not letting anyone see it. He\'s really caring in that he treats Christine like a goddess in all ways, honouring her voice and beauty. He does have, though, a very revengeful personality. For example, the phantom hangs the lighting director who stays up on the catwalk, when he tries catching the phantom. He also puts some sort of liquid in Carlotta\'s voice spray stuff to make her voice hoarse and unable to go up to the higher registers; this was because the owners of the opera put Carlotta in the role that the phantom meant Christine to be in; the lead. And numerous times the phantom tries to kill Raoul, who falls in love with Christine at the beginning, because Raoul loves the only girl the phantom has ever loved. The revengeful personality goes along great with his protection over Christine. at the same time, though, the phantom is a very caring man. his personality is actually a very extreme version of mine. i get jealous really easily but obviously i don\'t kill the person im jealous of out of revenge. And i love music, all aspects of it. I appreciate it so much since i\'ve been playing the piano for so long, and i am a very deeply caring person towards others! The phantom obviously lives a solitary life, living beneath the opera house away from everyone else. It\'s because he\'s been shunned by society because of his face. Overall, the phantom makes me sad sometimes because he just wants to be loved, like alot of other people do in the world. He just proves that in very dynamic ways. It\'s sad seeing someone that is forced to live a completely solitary life and who doesn\'t get the girl he loves and has loved all his life!!

1298^CC^O^activity5^the person that I think is interesting is from a book.  She is a strong personality and says it like it is.  She does not hide things be they feelings or truths or other things.  She also tends to have adifficult time letting others in, for example her boyfriend who loves her.  In many ways, she is quite similar to myself, but she is far more upfront with things than I am.  Honest, loyal, emotional, intelligent, unique, offbeat are all words that would describe both of our personalities.  She lives in a dorm room at NYU but she is always in touch with her friends and boyfriend.  Though she tends to shut them all out when she is feeling emotional problems (quite similar to myself).  It does not describe really what types of food she eats, although when her and her girlfriends get together they eat a lot of junk food.  and the few times she is discussing where she has gone to eat it tends to be ethnic places such as Mexican and Chinese.  She can be shy, but she is approachable and very honest.  Even with the customers at the ovie store she works at.  I just feel more at ease when I read bits of the book that are about her as she is funny and a little bit odd, she does not follow the typical idea of a university student and so she makes me a bit more at ease.

1167^NR^O^activity5^I chose a dog. I think that dogs are very strong creatures that have human like instincts especially in times of trouble. A dog can sense things going on in its surroundings which is a pretty cool characteristic. Dogs absolutely do have a personality, some are gentle, some are temperamental etc. I do think that sometimes dogs do adapt to the personality of its owners. Dogs do usually live a solitary life unless it\'s owners do have more than one dog, however genrally speaking if a dog were to see another of its kind it would interact with it in a friendly way. Dogs generally eat dog food and they usually live with their owners, there aren\'t many wild dogs around this area. Dogs do obviously interact with people since they usually live with people. I do like dogs i like how they give you a sense of protection.

1217^NR^O^activity5^For this activity I am going to talk about my puppy dog, Buddy. Buddy is a beagle-mix. We adopted him about three or four years ago from a pet rescue near our home. Buddy was rescued all the way from Ohio, where he was clearly being abused and almost lost his life to a gas chamber. As soon as we saw Buddy, we knew he was the one we wanted. Buddy is brown with black on his back, and white on his face. He also has white freckles on his legs. He has floppy ears that are so soft, and over all he is a very cute dog. Buddy was very timid and scared at first, but after a few months of proper care and lots of love he was able to grow into a friendly, cuddly, hyper-active dog. Now that I live away from him for school, it is hard not to miss him. He misses me too! Every time I go home he is always waiting to greet me at the door, like he knows I am coming, and every time I walk through the door he is all over me in seconds. We love each other very much, and it is a wonderful feeling to have a pet that gets so excited to see you. We gave Buddy the life he deserves and I am so happy we could make a difference.

The horses have different personalities this can all be seen when one on one in the stall as well as on its back. When observing horses in paddocks we can see how they act with one and other its fascinating to watch. Horses do not live solitary lives at all they are very social. Horses are herbivores they eat veggies and hay and grass. Some are even known to eat candy. This animal makes me feel serene calm and peaceful.

This person definitely has a personality, she is dramatic at times-but only when it is justifyable. Her personality is similar to mine the the way that she is able to overcome difficult situations when they do arise, however she does not encounter these hardships very often opposed to me. She lives a life with an amazing boyfriend and outstanding mother. She drinks alot of coffee (which i have just begun doing since coming to university) and eats a balanced diet, indulging in donuts on occassion. She lives in a very small town where everyone knows everyone (which i think is cute and admire) and she lives in a nice house. She interacts very friendly and welcoming to everyone she talks to on a regular basis. This young woman makes me feel happy and uplifted when i watch her on tv.

Individual cats have also been known to learn on their own to manipulate simple mechanisms, such as doorknobs. Cats use a variety of vocalizations and types of body language for communication, including meowing, purring, hissing, growling, squeaking, chirping, clicking, and grunting. cats are very sociable, love to stay with humans. it lives on land. like to eat fish and small species. it can lve both in the buildings  and wild.    .

I am amazed at his colors..an orange tabby,he has very unusual stripes, almost like a giraffe. The similarities between us aren\'t that strong, except that we can both be playful and affectionate in nature.  He lives with me and my 2 children, in an urban setting, and finds food easily in his dish every day at the dinner hour.  He interacts with other cats and dogs, unusual for a feline I know, but true.  He has a curious nature and makes friends  easily.  My cat makes me feel more relaxed, and will curl up on my lap and keep me company as I spend hours reading textbooks and reviewing notes. He also listens patiently if I need someone to talk to about my daily frustrations lol!

1325^NR^O^activity5^My animal is my pet, Spaz.  It is a kitten, and the name says it all.  I love that it is cuddly, and needy, and always there when I need it.  Those are probably our similarities too.  Unlike me however, it is the only one of its kind in the apartment.  We have another pet that is a fish, and our cat tried to eat the fish.  If it was jealousy, it was misplaced because everyone in the apartment loves the kitten...  Only I love the fish.  The cat eats cat food.  She is spoiled and gets wet and dry food, but I want to ween her off of wet food because it makes her smell disgusting.  She must live a fairly boring life because today she Indiana Jones style launched herself off of the couch and clung to the curtains, knocking them down.  I would also probably be mad bored though too, considering our apartment is not very big, and it\'s plain, and I don\'t like to spend time in it as is.  The kitten often makes me angry (ie. when she destroyed a full roll of toilet paper, or when she dragged my bra into the living room when I had guests).  But I love to snuggle with her.  She is soft and warm, and I like the fact that she is dependant on me, and that she trusts me to be there for her when she needs me.  I think that I having her around has filled the empty spot in me that used to be filled by my boyfriend; the knowing that there will always be someone there for you, and you are worthy of placing trust, patience, love and emotion into.  Pretty sad that a kitten is filling his void, but it could be worse.

1277^NR^O^activity5^The first animal that comes to mind is a monkey. Monkey\'s have always been one of my favorite animals. I admire the fact that they\'re so intelligent, yet I don\'t even think they realize it. Although they surely compete about other things, they don\'t/can\'t compete about who got a higher GPA or who got a larger scholarship and to me, that would be a relief. Other than intelligent, monkeys are also wild, energetic and most of the time they seem happy to be doing whatever they\'re doing. I believe monkey\'s appear to generally be happy and content, however I do believe they feel anxious for many reasons that I do not have to worry about. Monkeys, living in the wild, have to worry about when/where they\'ll find their next meal, where they\'ll sleep the next night, and they also always have to careful and on the look out for predators. Although I never have to worry about these types of these specifically, I generally tend to be very anxious and therefore worry about things that don\'t need to be worried about. Instead of enjoying life and only worrying about necessities, I tend to focus on the little things that don\'t really matter, or I over think big things, and make big problems/worries even biger.   Monkeys live with other monkeys in trees, in the jungle, and the only food I can be sure of them eating are bananas. I believe they are fairly social animals and therefore interact with others of their kind. When trained by humans, I also believe they can become extremely close to them and can grow to becomfortable in human company.   In general, monkeys make me feel happy. When I see the extent to which they can be trained, it makes me feel confident in humans for being able to make such an amazing thing happen, but i also feel amazed when thinking about the intelligence that a creature may posess.

The cheetah is one of the fastest land animals in the world,as well as a tremendous hunter.. This animal is one that is tremendous to watch in there natural habitat which is in the wild..  The food that it eats is other animals, these animals are carnivors..  With other animals I beleive that it interacts vary well, though i am not sure about this I think that these animals would protect there kin.    This animal makes me think about the tremendous power, speed and intelligence that this creature has, which contributes to its dominanince over other animals in the wild...

They are stubborn and intelligent, they also do not understand sarcasm well nor pick up on underlying comments that many people include with common phrases. It is not very similar to mine in that sense, but I would like to consider myself stubborn and intelligent. However, I use sarcasm all the time. They live in a group environment, surrounded by friends, which is similar to the way that i live. However I have no idea what food they eat, or where they live. They interact well with friends, and awkwardly with new people.

I see a similarity to myself as I enjoy spending time with my own family as well and depend on them. If I had to choose words depicting how this animal is similar to me i would say \"strong\", \"loyal\", and \"protective\". This animal lives on the African plains, in a dry landscape that I imagine to be yellow-gold, with sparse trees. It communicates with others through guttural sounds and roars as well as through body language. The lion rarely interacts with people, regarding them as hostile and intruders. I feel the lion is a noble and courage animal, but maybe I\'ve just seen The Lion King too many times.

She is a very critical woman, very aware and alert to all subtleties and feelings surrounding the situations she is in. She tends to be prejudice due to her confidence in her judgments. She lives with her family, as was customary in her time, but you can tell that her family is the source of her power. She has a very close relationship to her father, as I do. She eats well, as I do. She is romantic but in a way that isn\'t flighty or unrealistic... she\'s a woman of intellect and confidence and beauty... I believe we are comparable. She makes me feel as though I can fight the fights I want to fight.

1361^NR^O^activity5^Though I am not the biggest fan of monkeys, I have read alot about them in the book that i am currently reading. However, when I was watching monkeys once I did admire/was in awe at how the two of them interacted together. They sat close to each other and were amical and caring for each other. Monkeys do have personalities, but just like in humans these personalities vary depending on the monkey. Some might be brighter then others, some might be better at hunting or making a tool. THey can be both friendly or irriated at one another. All in all they are similiar in behavior to us in their own ways so the best way to describe my similarity to them is: living, concious and aware. Monkeys usually live in groups together. Some monkeys are vegetarian but others eat meat as well. (bugs, or even other monkeys)  They live normally in the wild unless captured and put on display in zoo\'s or for circus/media acts. Some monkeys interact with each other in the same way humans do, they will have time for when social contact is needed/required (when they groom each other) and other times when they don\'t want to be bothered by other monkeys. (if an infant is irritating and wants to play but the mother is tired)

1399^NR^O^activity5^An animal that I think is intersting is a monkey. Monkeys are so much like humans and many different ways. There ability to communicate with us is amazing and their personalities tend to be warm and charming.  They act out; as they are monkeys and I think that\'s why I enjoy them so much, they are always good for a laugh. The similarities that monkeys share with humans is, the walk on two feet, they are able to communicate using sign language, and they are also able to show emotion. Monkeys tend to live among a group of monkeys; their family as we do.  I know from an anthropology class that they eat twigs, leaves and fruit, and live in the forest surrounded my lots of trees to climb and swing from. As I said before monkeys interact with people through ASL, and also through their emotions. Monkeys make me feel warm and fuzzy. They always make me smile when I see one on T.V. a movie, magazinze, or even better the zoo.

Its personality is obviously different a human and a bird has different goals in life. a bird can only accomplish so much but it still cares for its family the same. Birds are mostly always with their family (if they have any family) and they always fly together in a pack when the winter comes. I think birds eat worms...and of course like random crap on the floor. (thats a difference MOST humans dont eat random crap and worms :P!!) Their home is a nest which they have to build so in a way birds are quite smart when it comes to construction. Im not educated enough in the field of birds to know how exactly how they interact so i wont even try. I guess it interacts with people if you have them for pets or if you see them off the streets. This animal maks me think of one word and thats freedom. The freedom to fly and do what you want. A bird is a very inspiration animal. Kinda like \"if you cant climb a mountain grow some wings and fly over it\"

I see that Booth and I have the same sense of feel for family, and friends. I feel protective at times of them and look out for them and can be a very strong individual. Overall booth insipres me in the sense he works with people he knows are smarter than him and regards their professions as just as difficult as being an FBI agent as well as stressfull.

1371^NR^O^activity5^The animal which I think is interesting is a cat. I have a pet cat.. what makes cats interesting is that they are very similar to humans in that they need love and attention, and do not like to be alone at all.... cats eat cat food, milk, tuna, chicken... pretty much anything... but of course, I do not feed him anything... Domestic cats live in homes, but they could live out in the wild, but it would have to be when they are kittens, so they can learn how to hunt, and keep that skill with them in old age. Cats usually interact with each other by jumping on each other and playing.... cats are constantly interacting with people... cats are so warm and cuddly and lovable, they make me feel loved and befriended.

She was passive and trusting at first but became independent and showed courage. Her personality seemed to be somewhat similar to mine but also different. Some similar words to describe her to me would be curious, determined, strong, smart, thoughtful. She was living with her husband and her daughter, then moved on her own with her daughter. Food? i have no idea. Normal stuff i suppose. They lived in the united states somwhere, im not too sure where exactly. She lived in a house. She used a fake name for a number of months in order to remain hidden from her ex. She would always interact with people, but was very careful how she said things and what she said. She empowers me to do what i need to do. Makes me realize how bad things can get and how things can turn out if i don\'t take action NOW. Worries me to know what can happen, but opens my eyes to terrible possibilities.

We may have some of the same aspects about our personality but overall she seems to be more set and understanding.  The life she lives is a fairy tale life.  She probally eats healthy foods to maintain her nice figure. She lives in a crazy house filled with lots of nicknacks and crazy inventions.   Her interations with others are very thoughtful and nice.

He is couragous and brave and looks for ways to improve himself and the city.  I would consider batman to have a personality although I wouldn\'t consider our personalities to be similar.  Batman is more outgoing than myself and I admire him for the qualities that he posseses, which are not reflective in himself.  Batman lives with his butler alfred, but in general he rarely becomes close to anyone of the opposite sex because of his secret identity.  Batman eats out a lot, at fancy restaurants especially, without wearing his batman mask.  batman lives in a giant mansion in gotham city.  batman interacts with others by saving people from harm and capturing criminals.  he often talks with officer gordon of the police as well.  batman makes me feel happy because he is so brave.

He currently lives in Princeton in a aparment with his friend Wilson.  Everything in his life seems to be a game to him, he is always looking to win the argument.    He is not very similar to me at all, besides his sarcastic sense of humour.

I wouldnt say I am anything like the personality of a cat, I would say im more ofa dog person. the cat is surrounded by people in the house but usually stay to itself. It eats only dry cat food, its not one of those prissy cats who eat only wet food. the cat stands its ground, is not very friendly with other animals but is friendly with people.

1364^CC^O^activity5^The character I am thinking about is a woman.  She is a very strong woman, and very determined.  I admire how she handles herself in an environment dominated by men.  She is greatly respected and has a very important role which allows the facility where she works to run to its full potential.  She is very respectful of other cultures she encounters, but is always free to speak her mind should she find anything unfair.  In some ways we are the same, because I try to be understanding of peoples cultures, and immerse myself in them as much as possible.  I like to be in a position of power, in order to allow my job to run smoothly.  In some ways I am quite different.  I am sometimes not very outspoken, and sometimes I let a situation get the best of me.  She lives in close proximity to her teammates in the building where she works, but is able to get time away from this place.  She is constanly interacting with various people on a daily basis, and is always glad to meet new people.  This character is actually quite inspirational.  She is very much involved in woman\'s issues that arrise, she is always available to help, and she has a great nurturing characteristic.  If anything I feel like she would be a great friend, and she makes me aspire to perhaps be a little more understanding of people sometimes.

The \'personality\' a giraffe is known as very calm and patient. This is comparable to my personality, as I am also fairly calm for the most part, as I do not get upset very easily. The giraffe lives with others of its kind, living amongst other giraffes in small communities. It normally lives in the plains of Africa, grazing for food in this landscape. In the wild, it does not come into contact with people on a regular basis, however, it does come into contact with people when it is raised in captivity. This animal makes me feel calm and peaceful, as it almost feels like a source of comfort.

1395^NR^O^activity5^I done this activity number 5 already, but there was an error when sending it. So, just in case...    I chosed the Arctic Fox as the animal of choice. I admire this animal because of it\'s gentle image, unlike the wolf who seems more fierce. Softness of the animal to me is not a sign of wreakness but a feeling of sensitive and gentleness.     The animal\'s eyes also portray a hidden secret of nature of life; and that the truth of it is depressing that it resides to a life in the artic landscape of harsh winter.    But, the animal seems ready to tackle the winter, for it has what some experts say the warmest fur out of all the mammals. This makes me think that the animal genetically chose to adapt to stay in this place as long as possible, and instead of venturing off to other warm places.    The food this animal mainly survives on could be rabbits, but i\'m not too sure. I haven\'t looked too much on the animal. Maybe some fish?    The animal in pictures seems to prefer a life a complete solitude until it requires a mate. This is a contrast to images of wolves travelling in packs. In a way, this animal sense of relying on oneself to survive is something i\'m leaning towards these days.     I picked this animal because it would be nice to get away from troubling humans destroying the world like an unstoppable virus. Well, with global warming acting up, i don\'t know how this would affect the animal. Would it cause the humans to move further north? or the animal to move south? Anyway, the rate of the humans are rising, i think the contact to between them and us, is evitable.    Overall the animal seems to be mysterious in nature, but sticks to it\'s own life and doesn\'t bother other creatures. It makes me feel calm looking at this animal, and the drive it has to have to live in such a cold place that would seem so lonely for other animals including us (hence the winter blues). But, there is some beauty one could find. I wonder if they could ever comprehend the beauty of the night sky. The stars must be just breathtaking out there. And what about the northern lights? I guess one could ponder that could be the reason they decided to stay out there for so long.

We both are very opinionated and will do anything for the ones we love. We know how to outsmart people and can sense when people are bad guys. Summer and I share lots in common. Her entire life has been with other people. She grew up with lots of friends, always very popular. She has had many different step moms also. She eats everyday food but it\'s very pricey. She lives in Orange County, California. She lives in a mansion. She interacts like a normal person would with other people. There is constant interaction with people. She makes me very happy, I love watching the show because I can always relate to her.

He is a very moral, selfless, and determined man. He\'s never actually seen eating so i have no idea what or if he even eats. he is like a machine. I like to think that him and i are alike in the fact that we would both devote ourselves to the greater cause. i like to think that if it came down to it, i would make selfless decisions for others as he would. Overall, he makes me feel pretty pumped up. He does so much in a single episode that it makes me feel like i could do so much as well.

I always appreciated how she showed unconditional love to all the family members.  She always wanted attention, and that attention back.  She did have a personality.  Although we had a tendency to anthropomorphisize the dog\'s behaviour,  she did have habits and quirks that could be attributed to her character.  She was very protective of our family members and never liked the mail.  She could be similarly described to me as a fun dog who loved everyone around her.  She was never a social dog with other dogs, but lived with all of us continuously.  She ate regular dog food, although that was changed to diet dog food has she aged.  She brought a tremendous amount of joy into our lives, and we were all very sad when she finally passed.  Her memory always makes us laugh, and when we tell stories of some of her behaviour we still get to laugh and feel happiness.

1377^NR^O^activity5^Our family has a talking grey parrot, with a brilliant red tail.  Her name (we think of her as a she although we don\'t know her sex) is Vermillion. She has lots of flight feathers (more than average according to our vet) which are a deeper black.  She can glide but not fly, because she is kept indoors and has her flight feathers slightly clipped, which prevents her from a really good take off.  She is on loan to us, and originally came from the Cameroon about 20 years ago.  She has two holes for her nostrils, a very sharp and pointed beak, highly expressive eyes and 3 finger claws.  She probably has the intelligence of a 2 to 4 year old.  She is fascinating to watch as she skilfully manipulates and opens walnuts, peanuts or almonds with her beak and claws.  She loves cashews best, but pistachios and walnuts are a close second.  She also likes vegetables and fruit reasonably well, especially corn, beans, broccoli and carrots, or grapes, bananas or pears.  She is a very sociable lady, insisting on joining us in the kitchen for meals, and will enjoy the odd vegetable from our plate.  She has a small but high appropriate set of phrases and noises, which she produces, not when we request them, but when she feels like talking.  Her most amusing phrases are:  \"What\'s going on?\"; \"I can talk.  Can you fly?\", Ring sound like telephone, followed by \"Telephone\", and then \"Hello\" and some muttering like a real conversation,  and she gurgles when we drink water.  Our friends always loves it when she says \"Bye, Bye\" or \"See you later\".  We sometimes call her baby, to mark her place in our family as we also have an older daughter, and a younger daughter, now called the middle child, since the arrival of Vermillion, our baby child just over 4 years ago.  We love her but can get annoyed with her, as she pecks away at the quarter round on the bathroom floor boards, the set of curtains behind her cage, our furniture and various other things.  Cleaning her cage is no fun either.  But like other members of the family, we live with her foibles and we\'ll miss her greatly, when she returns to her owner in another year or two.

I admire the fact that he has no responsibility really and that he can always get excited about the usual and simple things that happen in his day. He is very lazy and quite stubborn. I think my dog has a lot of personality. When you tell him to do something like a trick or just to come inside after a walk he decides for himself whether that is a good idea or not. He has a similar personality to mine in that we are both stubborn and don\'t like doing things we don\'t want to do. He is also very social and loves to be around people and general doesn\'t like being alone like me. My dog eats the same dry dog food everyday and yet somehow he is always excited to eat. He also likes a lot of weird human food like grapes, carrots and all kinds of meat. My dog is a very indoor dog and he doesn\'t like to swim which is weird for a lab. He is a very winter dog he likes the snow. My dog doesn\'t interact with other dogs very well but that\'s probably because he never sees them except on walks but he loves people and is really good around kids. I love being around my dog especially when I\'m having a bad day cause he just cuddles with you and keeps you warm.

Probably because she is uncomfortable with unknown others. She thinks highly of herself, and expects a lot from others. If people don\'t meet her standards, or disappoint her, they will suffer.   She lives alone. She had some roomates after her husband died, but her roomie moved out back with her family.   Neela and I have some similar characteristics. Firstly, we are seen as funny friendly people amongst friends. Secondly, both of us would prefer do things are selves rather than have to rely on others who could potentially let us down.  However we are also very different. I could not be rude to people as she is, and I live with a family rather than alone.   Overall, I like Neela, she is one of my favourite characters on the show. She has a complex personality and I think that makes her incredibly interesting.

They are very sleek looking creatures which are capable of doing many things.  Sharks go after what they want regardless of who is in their way, or how hard it is to accomplish.  I like this attribute in sharks, as they are not affraid of anything.  They will never back down due to fear.  They spend their lives touring around the ocean monitoring everything, making sure evrything, in their minds, is in check.  If not, they will take action.  They rarely interact with humans, but when they do, it is usually not pretty.  When it comes to other sharks, there are groups, but it is still the strongest that will survive.  They are the lions of the ocean, and are very fascinating creatures.

She is always looking out for people around her that mean alot to her like her roomate. Her personality is very spunky and unique. I would say i have a unique personality but not as much spunk. Words such as individualistic, fighter, stands up for what is right. She doesnt live a solitary life with people around he runtill later in the movie when she gains their respect. She would normally eat crappy food but since living with richard gere she eats well. she lives in a rundown apartment in a high up building. and he lives ina nice suite that is also high up.

She is a very exciting person and loves with her whole heart - and that shows in all areas of her life. I think her personality is a lot like mine (on a good day) and I ideally would like my life to be like hers! A family that would do anything for her and in the end supports her decisions (which I am blessed to have) and the whole idea of having one true love is very appealing to me.... and I feel I\'ve found that in my fiance! The character kind of motivates me to keep my head up and believe that love conquers all... and to stay positive! As for as actual lifestyles, they are very different, as from what you see in the movie she is from a rich family, which I am not, but her personality and outlook on life is what I strive for!

Charlie interatcs very well with other dogs, playing and kissing, unless the other dog is more dominant and then he shows his agressive side, never biting but making weird sounds to try and prove himself bigger and stronger than the others.  charlie makes me feel unconditionally loved and he brings an extreme about of love and admiration to me.

It\'s black and white stripes amaze me, just the was the move diagonally from each other to form a perpendicular movement at the belly, that\'s when they draw a sort of intermingled triangle. I don\'t think this animal has a \"personality\" as such because it just runs and doesn\'t talk or do anything human. The only way I could compare it to me is it\'s manner of running away from it\'s predators. Sometimes I could say it\'s shy, like me. One thing it completely differs from me is the way it stands out from all the rest. It\'s colors scream too loud. It lives with just others of it\'s kind, maybe it\'s shy to mingle with others of a different kind. Who knows? It lives in the wild where it\'s free to run for as long as it wants but it must make sure it\'s predators are away, far far away. This animal makes me feel like I should be more open and confident to stand out there and be visible to the rest of the world. Like it has all these qualities that stand out from all the other ones but yet it\'s too afraid to show off it\'s beauty.

I admire that he is calculated, calm, knows a lot of people and always grows as a person. Dantes has a personality that he has a single goal and he is committed to getting it, this goal is revenge against the conspirators who sent him to jail. Dantes and I have some similarities as we both seem to enjoy meeting new people, we both try to help others and we both believe in God. Some differences are that I have never been to jail, and I do not have any conspirators to deal with. Dantes eats small portions but this is because of spending so much time in prison I on the other hand enjoy eating larger portions. Dantes visits many places throughout the book like Paris, Marseilles, Turkey and Greece so he is well traveled I on the other hand have not been to as many places as him but I plan to get around to visiting the rest of the world. The Count lives on the Champ d\'Elysee which is now a bunch of stores (I have been to Paris to see the street). The Count is interacts with many people and always seems to be very humble because he thinks that he is to eastern compared to the people in Paris. The Count make me feel that there is always hope and that you never know who may help you in he future.

1301^NR^O^activity5^I chose a snake. A snake is interesting because it\'s very different from a lot of other animals. It\'s skin is very unique: smooth, cold, and it sheds on a regular basis. It can be any colour or design. It can smell with it\'s tongue and despite it\'s small size, it can eat whole mice, eggs, baby birds, etc. Also despite it\'s small size, it is very strong. Some are harmless, some are poisonous. Snakes are fast and sneaky. Some are docile, others are more active. I believe this is a figment of their personality. A snake is like me in some ways: I am surprisingly strong for my small body size and my eyes and hair, like their skin changes colour easily. Sometimes snakes can be fussy and not wish to be handled, and sometimes I do not like to be touched. I can be very quiet like a snake and it is easy for me to sneak up on people. Snakes and I enjoy dark spaces for solidity when we want to be alone. Snakes can live as pets, or in the wild, jungles, usually. Where else they live, I am not sure. Snakes are unique and I have never seen any two that were identical. I like snakes because I enjoy being unique and celebrating differences and I feel that this is what snakes represent.

I think that their characteristics are that they are happy and friendly and cute. Dolphins definitely have a personality! Depends on the dolphin. I think its somewhat similar to mine because i like to swim and i dont like sharks and pleasure is a good thing. Dolphins live with others of its kind and are overall very sociable! Dolphins live in the Ocean. They eat little fish and seaweed. Dolphins love to interact with people, its said that they can heal.  This animal makes me feel happy and warm inside.

They are smart enough to know when your sad and lay quitely with you. Sometimes they even have their own little ways of putting their \"arms\" around you. I have alsways had really cool dogs with the neatest personalitys. I think at one time I had a similar personality to a dog... always happy ... One thing i could not understand was feeing a dog only dog food... how boring that must be... we always had dog food in their dish but would always feed them real food for dinner everyday. I miss having a dog.. even though they can be a big responsibilty..

The character is very mysterious type of person who can be really cold and serious all of the time, but on the flip side they are also very caring and gentle. the only difference between the two is that the character in the book is really reserved, whereas the person I know in real life is very open to meeting new people and doing new things. they are both very adventurous as well.

I admire that in the movies, he tried to save everyone who was in trouble, even if he didn\'t feel like it, if he was busy, or if he was already saving someone else! Spiderman is brave, loyal, strong, and hardworking. I wouldn\'t say that I was brave or strong, but I do think I am loyal and hard working! He kind of lived two lives because his family and friends didn\'t know he was Spiderman, so he had to hide it from them. He lived a normal, ordinary life (except when he was saving peoples\' lives and saving the world).

1319^NR^O^activity5^The peregrine falcon is an amazing bird. It is the fastest bird in the world when it dives to catch it\'s prey in the air; I believe it might even be the fastest animal in the world when it dives. It is beautiful, small, and sleek. It has huge glassy eyes and a sharp hooked beak. It will build it\'s nest high up on cliffs, but it will also build in urban areas, putting it\'s nest on the tallest buildings. Other than immediate family, it\'s mate and offspring, it is a fairly solitary animal. I do not think the falcon and I have anything in common. I admire it because it is a beautiful, powerful animal. The problem is that the peregrine falcon is an endangered species. I would never want to see this animal become extinct. I don\'t know what it is that I love about this bird, but it is such an incredible bird. I\'ve never seen one in real life, but when I look at pictures, I feel a great sense of awe. The grace and the power that they have is fantastic. I feel both calm and excited when I think about them. It\'s soemthing that I can\'t even describe, because I feel so many things when I think about them. They are just fascinating creatures.

The cheetah mainly eats meat. This animal has a need for speed that I myself want. It will not generally interact with any other animals other than its own species unless this animal is about to be the cheetah\'s food source. Whenever I see this animal in the zoo, I think that it has been stripped of its nature as it is caged, cannot interact in its usual surrounds, and has lost the will to live. Cheetahs are symbol to me as they represent the fast and fiery passion that is inside of me.

It resembles a small bear which lives in the trees and has huge ears and an almond shaped nose. The animal is probably very laid back and friendly. I think the animal has a more relaxed personality then my own, but I don’t know very much about it, I hardly know anything about it. I believe it lives in a forest and probably with others of its kind. I think it’s an herbivore and eats leaves and plants. I have heard it eats a type of leaf that contains alcohol? It lives only in Australia I believe, not sure about the landscape, probably in a type of forest. It lives in the wild but some live in zoos. I haven\'t got a clue of how it interacts with others; I don’t think they\'re aggressive animals probably just like the company of others and like to sit together in the trees. It might only interact a little bit with people in a zoo but I don’t think they interact with people as much as a household pet would. It made me feel calm and interested.

I like being around others to an extent but don\'t deal well with them for long periods of time. It eats cat food - wet and dry. I spoil her and give her milk when I\'m home. She\'s an indoor cat but she sometimes run outside and up and down my suburban neighbourhood.  I love my cat, she is my favourite and will always be.

She sleeps a lot and has weak legs. She doesn\'t like to go on walks and she will only go outside if someone goes with her. She doesn\'t like to be alone, which is similar to me. She is happier when she is surrounded by people which is a similiar personality trait to me. She is loving and enjoys males. She eats regular dog food, but she prefers treats. Her favourite treat is any kind of human food, especially cheese, but she hates grapes. She lives in my house, but she generally stays in one part where her bed is since she is old and has difficulty walking up stairs. Since Scoma has gotten older, she isn\'t as friendly towards other animals. She isn\'t violdent with them but she doesn\'t really pay any attention to them. When she was younger she was more playful, but now she shows no interest in other dogs, especially puppies. Although she isn\'t interested in other dogs she still loves people. She is very friendly and never bites, and she loves being petted. I love my dog and she makes me incredibly happy. I get extremely excited when I go home and get to see her because I miss her while I am away at school.

They are stoic, and quiet. They are loyal to their packs, even in a barren savanah. They can travel for days just to reach water. Determined animals. They hardly ever interact with people. Its a herbivoire, gentle, not a killer. Im still finding my personality. I cant really tell sometimes weither im loyal, stoic, or gentle. Elephants make it look simple. This calms me and aggravates me at the same time. When going through rough things, you wish that it could be simple. The world laid out in front of you, clear missions - Water, reproduction, protection. Loyalty. I do not believe humans are ultimately loyal.

This animal makes me feel comforted and happy.

As well, she always had an innate ability to know when something was wrong and to come comfort you. Here characteristics were being wildly fluffy, short, sort of pudgy, small, defensive, protective and very cuddly. She most definitely had a personality. She was excitable, sometimes lethargic and often fussy with her dog food. She was very much a good cross between my dad and I personality wise (as we raised her) however, we\'re the least picky people with food that we know. She lived among people since she was five and a half weeks old. She lives off of wet or dry food, and whatever Dad gives her when he caves when she would beg at the table. She lived at home with my dad and I when i lived at home and she had a large backyard to play in. I think what exhausted her most was following us up and down 3 flights of stairs with the 3 floors we had in our house. When she met other dogs, when she was young she was excited to snoop them out but as she grew older she didnt really seem to care about the other dogs around her. She was constanly around people whether she was on a walk or just at home with the family. Tessy always made me feel well loved and cared for and it was exciting and wonderful to love and care for her too. She was most certainly apart of the family.

Gypsy, my cat, lives and interacts with my family at home in Florida. My parents and brother love her a lot and they treat her like family. They often give her table scraps. Gypsy loves tuna, chicken, and even cream cheese!     Although Gypsy loves my family, she doesn\'t get a long with other cats. When we tried to get another one, she didn\'t react very well to him. She is a very independent animal who is content with being the only animal in the house.   I miss my cat a lot, and I love her very much.

She gets a boyfriend who is from Brooklyn though, not as much money as her. It goes through the phases of her and her best friend and how she encounters problems. Serena, although she comes from much wealth, also has another side from her friends. She doesn\'t care what people think, no matter the circumstances and sticks up for her own, regardless of a popularity level. She is much more artsy aside from her group of friends and enjoys hanging out with many different people. I like this, that she can be as wealthy and popular as she is, but still not care what people think or fall into traps of others and their levels of popularity.

They are cuddly and intuitive, playful and silly and their moods just like people alter from time to time. My cat resembles me in many ways and I feel has adopted some of my very same characteristics. She is social and inquisitive and always alert as to what is going on around her. She is picky with her food and will only eat dry food;in fact she doesn\'t prefer anything other than her regular meal, not even human food. She lives at home with me and follows me everywhere I go...sleeps in my bed and even sits on the ledge of the tub when I take a shower. She is definitely domesticated in every sense of the way and resembles a baby more than an animal. She is a great relief from the stresses of everyday life such as school and work and provides me with a lot of joy.

1308^CC^O^activity5^The fictional character I\'ve chosen is Carmen from The Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants. She is the blunt, outgoing, and is multi-faceted. Her role in the group of four friends is to keep a bit of structure and constancy to the friendship.     I admire her emotional strength, although she has a soft side. Carmen has been through a lot - divorce, a broken family trying to piece back together with a new addition, betrayal and a fear of falling in love.     She\'s a bit like me in that I don\'t like to show my emotional side to many people unless I feel like I can truly trust them. In the past my trust has been broken a number of times and I like to prevent that from happening yet another time.     Carmen inspires me to be strong and persevere through the problems that may show face. I see her as a quality friend, family member and individual who is not afraid to be herself.

He is strong, but also has weaknesses, such as anxiety and anger.  I think this person\'s character is somewhat similar to mine, as we are both brave and have positive outlooks on society.  We also both want the best for society and we want to do the right thing.  This person is married and is expecting a baby, and is heavily into their job.  They eat normal food, and live in a Brazilian city.  He lives in a small appartment with his wife.  This man doesn\'t spend enough time with his wife, and is committed to his job.  This person makes me feel that there are good people in the world who want to help people and do the right thing.  It makes me think positively about humanity.  He also makes me feel like he, like everybody else has character flaws and needs to work on their own problems.

I love him because he\'s so affectionate and always look for attention. He can sense when something is bothering you, like if you cry he will come to you. He\'s active and full of life but knows when to calm down. He makes me feel happy especially when I haven\'t seen him in a long time because he shows that he misses me too. He is very playful when he sees other dogs and gets overly excited. He loves to go into fields and just run freely, especially through long grass and he loves water. He lives with my mom in Almonte so unfortunately I don\'t get to see him all that often. He\'s really smart too. He does basic tricks, especially when a treat is offered. He also know when you\'re about to leave even before you\'re close to the door, if you say the word walk he jumps up and over to the door. Also if you tell him he\'s going for a car ride and let him outside he runs straight to the car. And even though he only sees me once a month now, he still knows who to run to when people say my name to him.

They keep on coming no matter how you try to stop them. They never give up. They are curious as well. Zombies have no personality in a way as they are completely mindless. But zombies are very different from me as they are mindless killing machines. They are similar in that they are passionate about what they do. They usually live in large groups, preferring the city life to the country. I prefer the quiet of the countryside. They eat brains. They are nomadic, traveling to where they can find food. They interact through moaning and eating. Zombies make me feel afraid.

The 2 dogs that I have had has pets have had very different personalities, one was very extroverted and loved to be around other dogs and people, while my other dog only likes people and is not too fond of most other dogs. Although both had the characteristics i listed before and they both are/were very playful. I think my personality is more between my two dogs. Wild dogs do live together but most are pets. Wild dogs eat meat while pet dogs mostly eat processed dog food and whatever people will give them off the table. They live in buildings mostly as pets, unless they are outdoor dogs then they still have a dog house usually. My current dog interacts with dogs by usually sniffing them a bit and then running away, my old dog would try and play with them or let them know that he was the alpha dog. My dogs do/did make me feel better, calm, loved, and at peace. Even though they may only seem to love me because I feed them, they still make you feel like they actually loved you and actually cared if you were upset or whatever.

1228^CC^O^activity5^The person I am thinking about is a character from the Twilight books series: Edward Cullen.  Edward is a vampire, he however is not like a regular vampire because he does not \"eat\" people.   What I admire of this character is that Edward cares for many people, he does not enjoy putting others down. He has a very caring heart.   Edward\'s personality is kind and gentle. He believes in treating others with care and those he really cares about he protects.   I would say that me and Edward have many similar characteristics, such as caring and protecting those we care about.   Edward lives with his vampire \"family.\" The food they eat is not the diet that others of his kind engage in. Most vampires choose to eat people, but Edward and his family only eat animals\' blood. They live in the woods near a city named Forks. And they live in a house, like any other person.   Many of the Cullens had a hard time communicating with others at first, but they are relatively socially accepted now. They interact with mainly each other.  Edward usually makes me feel relatively nice about myself, and my relationship. He is portrayed as \"the perfect man\" and that is something that all girls like to think about. In general Edward is very similar to me, not in all ways, but I like to read about him.

1386^CC^O^activity5^One of my favourite characters on television from when I was younger is Brooke Davis from a teen soap I used to watch. She was super popular, when she first started, and rude to anyone who wasn\'t her best friend. The thing I most admire about her is that she is fiercely loyal to her friends and loved ones. She\'s very funny, out going and sociable, strong, determined, and knows what she wants. Her personality is found in everyone\'s nick name for her: Cheery. Brooke\'s personality does have some similarities to mine (we both talk more than we breathe and are loyal) but she\'s definitely a lot different in the sense that she\'s much more open to new experiences than I am. She\'s also not afraid to get what she wants, no matter who it hurts (unless its her friends/family) which is different from me because I\'m always worried about hurting strangers as well as family. Brooke\'s out going personna is actually a facade, since we find out later in the show that she\'s actually very secretive and doesn\'t like to bother other people with her problems. She eats junk food. Lives in the biggest mansion in her fictional town. She\'s bossy but kind and very selfless to those she takes under her care. The reason why I love the character is mostly because she\'s strong and makes me laugh.

The other day I watched a video on christian the lion being reunited with his owners and it made me cry because there was so much love. I think its personality is similar to ours. A little less high strung maybe. It lives with others of its kind in prides. Words to describe it and me...soft, temperamental, hungry. It eats meat. Whatever animals it can kill. It lives in Africa mostly I think. In the savannah. It lives in the wild. It interacts well with animals of its kind that are in the same pride, and hesitantly and defensively with those outside of its own pride. It does interact with people. Some people are crazy enough to own them. You can go and visit them at the zoo. This animal makes me feel jealous. I wish i got to sleep so much.

I admire this person\'s social abilities - how she is friendly and always seems to find a way to fit in wherever she goes. She is beautiful and confident. Her life proves to be quite difficult for her, and she often has trouble dealing with the strong emotions that exist inside her. Her personality is quite eccentric, as she is a fairly emotional person who sometimes lets stress get the best of her. She is greatly admired in school and participates well in activities to help the community. Her personality is very similar to mine; we both are outgoing, genuinely caring people, but at the same time we both seem to crack easily under pressure. We are both very emotional people. She lives a life in which she surrounds herself with people constantly, but seems to isolate herself in difficult times. I do this as well. She eats very classy food, as she lives in a high-status neighborhood, and her dad is the richest man in the city. Her house resembles a mansion. She interacts with others fairly well, except when she has problems in her life, because these seem to be the moments where she abandons those around her. She makes me feel understood, because throughout the show she experiences similar events that I have experiences, and we seem to cope with things in very similar ways.

They are intelligent and they are aware of many things. Their senses and vibrant alertness is amazing. Dogs live amongst people and eat their own dog food; however, the food which they eat must have specific nutrients, just like how humans must consume specific nutrients to live a healthy life style. Dogs make one feel comfortable and lively, because they are always active and energetic , they really keep one on their feet!

She is self dependent but very caring and over protective of ones that she cares about. he can come across as being very mean and unapproachable but for those who know her she is extremely caring.  She is similar to me in some aspects but in all she is everything that I strive to be. Very caring and not selfish at all. She is the last on her priority list if at all there to begin with.  She likes her space but will let people be around her when she can tolerate it.  She does not live in any particular place. She travels as she sees fit never really stopping to settle down.

Chikko has kind of long white hair, he is small. Chikko does have a personality. He\'s like a little kid. He does things even though he knows it\'s wrong to; he\'s a troublemaker. His personality is kind of like mine but not really. Stubborn, loud, playful could be some words to describe him. Chikko lives with my family. Chikko eats dog food and sometimes he gets treats. He lives at my house, his bed is in the basement. He is nice to some ogs but to others he barks and growls. Chikko interacts with people all the time considering he lives with people. Chikko makes me feel happy; i love him very much

1263^NR^O^activity5^I think that wolves are one of the most intelligent, fierce, graceful and pack-oriented animals. Wolves are very smart, hunt in packs, and are very interactive with each other, but conversely can be solitary if they are not a part of a pack. I would definitely say that wolves have a personality that I would describe as very curious, rambunctious and very fun-loving. I admire many of the traits of wolves, and think that I tend to have a similar relationship with close-knit \"pack\" members, but tend to be more introverted at times. Words that would describe myself and wolves are: active, playful, intelligent, laid-back, and occasionally fierce. Wolves eat fish, deer, rabbits, mice, and other game depending on where they live. Wolves can live in forests, or in the arctic and have managed to adapt to different types of environments all over the world. Wolves can however also be found in zoos, but are not to be kept as pets (even wolf-dogs). Wolves can interact with people, but that would mostly occur in a situation where wolves were brought up by people. Wolves are very affectionate towards their pack mates, particularly the pups and have a pack hierarchy. Wolves make me feel inspired and happy.

They know when you aren\'t feeling the best and they will come and curl up with you and purr to try and make you feel better. They also know when you want to be alone and they will let you be not bugging you at these moments and times. They love to go outside and it\'s nice to see them enjoying life. I do feel a bond and connection with my cats. They love to be around people so long as they aren\'t screaming children all the time. My cats make me feel safe and comfortable. They are something nice to come home to and they are something I can trust. They are strong willed and very funny to in what they do. They love to be a part of the family and will force there way to get what they want at times. They are certainly spoiled because they are just so cute.

It loves people and craves their attention. It makes me feel happy everytime i see it.

He fights ghosts, demons, angels, and other supernatural things.  and sorry just to get distracted for a second WHY IS THERE A PICTURE OF A FREAKY CLOWN WEARING A COWBOY HATE ON THIS WEBPAGE???  WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH HAPPINESS???!?!?!/ WHY IS IT THERE!! omgzz. first there is a picture of happy students then a freaky old clown of doom? actually he kind of reminds me of one of the episodes of Supernatural, there is an evil clown and Sam and Dean (sam is dean\'s little brother) have to kill/exorcise it.   So Dean is the oldest son in the Winchester family. their mother was killed when they were very young by a demon. she burnt up in the nursery. they have lived on the road since then. their father john is on a quest for revenge and gets rid of other evil supernatural things to.    Yes, Dean has quite the personality. he is sarcastic and rebellious and just generally badass. I am sarcastic, I can be rebellious and I like to think I\'m a bit of a badass but I do not hunt ghosts. :P Badass? Dean lives a solitary life. He and his family have been constantly on the move since his mothers death. when his brother went to college it caused a rift in the family. but now they are back together trying to find their dad, who then died, and now trying to find the demon who killed their mom. Dean eats fast food, diner food. Dean lives in his goooorgeous 1967 chevy Impala. Dean interacts suspiciously with most other people. other than attractive women... he interacts badly with law enforcement, after a long list of random felonies he is now wanted for a bunch of murders (he didnt do it it was a shapeshifter :P) but now they think he\'s dead........ This person makes me feel happy because he is great, and interesting and awesome.   So yes I am a geek. But Dean Winchester is great so thats ok.  P.S. that clown picture is creepy. careful if Dean Winchester catchs wind of it he might have to hunt it down because it is obviously some sort of evil supernatural entity. :P

1400^CC^O^activity5^My favourite fictional character is House, from the tv show.  I admire his character because of his medical abilities and absolutely comical sarcastic attitude toward life. There is something about his being mean to people who care about him as if to push their buttons and see what he has to do to get them to their limits... It attracts my attention as it makes me want to figure out why someone wold act like that. There is also the fact that one of my close friends has a similar attitude so it draws a sort of paralel. He has a very strong personality but I can\'t compare it to mine, as I don\'t tend to be mean to people at all.. Although when I get crancky I am pretty irritable and can get mad easily. I guess we are both stuborn.   He is basically unable to make new friends because he is so harsh and mean to everybody for no real reason and the people he interacts with are his co-workers and patients which he 1)drives cracy and 2)he scares.

She is unique from those around her as she thinks that intelligence is better than beauty even when she is critisized for always having her face stuck in a book. I feel that I can relate to Belle as I\'ve always been more inclined to regard my intelligence higher than my beauty. Belle still treats everyone with fairness, even the Beast. I try to do the same when dealing with people that I may not get along with, but I will try to see them in a different light. I think Belle is a great role model for young girls as she was for me as she shows what is really important about life.

I don\'t know if he\'d have a \'personality\', and if he did it certainly wouldn\'t be similar to mine. He lives a solitary life despite the fact he is in contact with so many people. I\'m sure he would eat anything because he\'s very adventurous. He lives in England, I imagine in his own house. He is very seperate from others, he has friends, enemies, and the girls he sleeps with, but he is not close to anyone (except Vesper in Casino Royale of course). He regularly interacts with people, especially pretty ladies. James Bond doesn\'t make me feel anything... he\'s a fictional character that I watch for enjoyment.

She is a free spirited woman who has no idea what her imperfections are. She does not make friends with many girls but mostly men which is not like me at all. She starts with a life of loneliness with barely no other interactions other than her boyfriend. When she moves to the insane asylum, she gets close with the girls by understanding and caring for them. I myself am a very caring person towards others even if they suffer from illnesses. She rarely eats which is not similar to myself. She then realizes in the end that friends are the best support anyone can have, and from that character I can relate to how valuable a friend can be.

He wants what is best for the greater good, regardless of how that may effect him.  He\'s so brave.  Braver than any character I\'ve ever met (in the fictional world).    He is similar to me in ways... on the inside.  But very different on the outside.  We\'re both stubborn, as I already mentioned.  We\'re both very loyal, and very bold.  I\'m not as brave though, and I\'m certainly not as selfless.  I\'m a lot more easy going than him though, a lot more outgoing, a LOT more bubbly.  He lived alone for so long... I can\'t even imagine feeling so alone... And then one day a whole new world opened up for him.  With possibilities, and magic and friends.   He lives in a boarding school.  Which I think would be kind of cool, I guess it\'s kind of like living in residence... minus you are a lot younger, and I imagine I would get a lot more homesick.  But my character doesn\'t really have a home, so it would be like heaven to him.    He is my favourite all-time character.  He\'s so endearing, makes you care so much about him even though if you were able to talk to him, I\'m sure he\'d tell you not to - to worry about yourself.  In a good way.  He gives me hope.  He intrigues my imagination.  He makes my dreams a lot more interesting.    Sometimes he frustrates me, but I think what frustrates me with him are the same things that frustrate me with myself... so I can\'t even get all that angry, because it just puts me in check.

1428^CC^O^activity5^The fictional person I picked is Ash, from Evil Dead (played by Bruce Campbell). He is a fair, reasonable man who fights things (different in every movie) with a shotgun and his chainsaw arm. When he is not saving the world he works as an employee of S-Mart. Shop smart; shop S-Mart. What i admire about Ash is his broad chest and his sharp, well structured jaw bone. His characteristics include modesty, grace, and all around good judgement. He shares the common man\'s personality, yet is caught in the wrong place at the wrong time. I think his personality closely resembles my own. Where Ash lives is unknown, but for the duration of the movies I would classify his behavior as solitary. He sometimes interacts with other people, but they usually turn out to be evil, or die soon after. This person makes me feel \"groovy\".

He lives with people, other animals and spends time alone so over all his life is quite balanced. He eats cat food and treats. He lives back home. Buildings very much out of the wild in his environment, he\'s an indoor cat.He very much enjoys the company of other cats, not dogs though. He interacts more with people than any other kind of animal. He makes me feel  calm and happy when I\'m at home and sad when I\'m away from home because I miss him.

They eat normal food but are known to indulge in sweets.  This person lives in the North Pole.  This person interacts with others in work and play and this person makes me feel happy and have a positive outlook.

She is a black and dark brown striped cat with wonky whiskers and wild eyes, and she has grown an enormous about in the 2 months that I have had her. I guess you could say that her personality is cheeky, and I imagine that some people would use that to describe me. I named her Spaz because that\'s exactly what she is, and I am as well (in a fashion). I think most people would call me clumsy, and I think that those people would realize that Spaz is also. She lives with myself and my two roommates in an apartment building, and eats the very expensive cat food I get for her. I have yet to see her come into contact with others cats, but it interacts with people quite a lot and seems sociable enough. I love my kitten, I\'m in Kingston now and I miss her. She makes me happy, except for when she wakes me at 7:00 in the morning for breaky.

Characteristics include amazing physical strength and special ability, as well as an attitude that there is a responsibility to do good.  Personality is very much the same as many of us but also unique.  Likes people, helping others, but also can be jealous and vengeful if hurt.  Determination, dedication, and empathy are similar qualities. Life is solitary  in the sense of hiding their normal identity.  Eats normal food Western food.  Lives in the big cities, in buildings.  Interacts both normally and under fake identity.  This person is reassuring and makes me in awe of their talent and confidence.

1475^NR^O^activity5^I\'m thinking of my horse, Mary. Mary was an interesting animal - her full name was Flying Mary, but we called her Crazy Mary. She had a habit of jumping over the pasture fence to get whatever she wanted - hay, oats, whatever. She was incredibly sweet, but very mischevious. She liked being with the herd but also having time away from it - like me, I guess. She was never the alpha mare, because she didn\'t need to be. If someone was picking on her, she would go away and come back as she pleased - she could go where they couldn\'t follow.   She lived on a farm pasture - heavens know we couldn\'t keep her in a stall long enough.  I loved Mary, because she would listen to me when I told her all about my terrible days at school, and never try to interrupt. She would gladly jump any fence I would put her to, if I had confidence in myself that we could make it over. In a way, she showed me the value of positive thinking in teamwork.   Mary died when I was 16, breaking her back while jumping the pasture fence one day. I don\'t really know if I\'ve completely dealt with my grief, and I still miss her. There is no one quite as exasperating but loveable as her.

In many ways, I find myself similar to him because of this, he\'s always trying to turn every situation into a funny one or make a joke about something. I try and do the same thing, trying to manipulate words into their literal meanings and turn them into jokes. Words I would use to describe him that are similar to me would be funny, sarcastic, smart, clutzy, unprepared and emotional. Chandler lives with other people, and interacts with other characters on the show all the time. He tends to eat food from fast food restaurants or anything from delivery which tends to be the same things that I eat. He lives in an aparetment building with  his friend Joey and his wife Monica, depending on when the show is taking place, and he interacts with them mainly by making jokes about anything they say and complaining about his relationship or work issues. This person makes me feel relaxed when watching him because of his humour and his way of approaching situations in manners that would be similar to ways I would deal with them.

I think he is different from me in both aspects because I\'m not very brave and I\'m also not very \"dorky\" He lives with his aunt, but he is a very lonely person with not very many friends.

This dog, among all dogs, does have a personality and from the ones I\'ve seen it\'s one of the most friendly and hyper.  Having the Puggle would make me feel more responsible and would even encourage me to go for more walks and enjoy nature more.

1126^CC^O^activity5^the person in my mind is from a book. she is very strong and determined and i admire her for her courage. she will stop at nothing to get what she wants when she wants it. she is very kind while being strong-willed. she takes time to understand other people and to try and make other people understand her. some of the experiences through her life i have also experienced, however, she has a pretty rough life, and i can\'t compare mine to hers. she was a slave that was brought over to america from africa, and her parents were both killed in front of her, along with all the friends she knew and had. she also lost her baby, and her husband. i think that most people in canada can\'t really compare to this. they may be able to compare to some aspects of it, but to compare to all of these is almost impossible. we are both strong and independent, and we do what we can to help both others and ourselves. she once lived a solitary life, however it changed when she ran away from her \'master\'. she lives with many, many other people that were also once slaves. they eat all the food they can find. it doesn\'t matter if they like it or not, they don\'t really have a choice because they don\'t have very much money to be picky on how they live. she tries to be nice to everyone, even when they pretend she does not exist, or don\'t take notice when she asks a question. this person makes me feel like i have more to be thankful for than i sometimes realize. this person opens my eyes to the evils of this world, and makes me want to stand up and fight against everything wrong with the world. she makes me feel privileged and wanted and strong. i feel like i can do most things when i think about her or the life she has lived. i feel like i can make a difference in this world and in someone\'s life.

She has a vibrant personality that people notice when she walks into a room and she is usually happy, and makes other people around her happy as well. She makes me feel like I can do anything I put my mind to but I need to work hard for it. She eats very healthy food which I cannot exactly follow because I do not like a lot of the food she eats.

1496^CC^O^activity5^Daffy Duck.  He is beyond unconventional, he is silly and clever at the same time.  He works outside of the laws of other characters he interacts with.  Daffy Duck does not tend to take situations and life too seriously.  He is eccentric, and has a zany sense of humor.  His personality is clearly different than mine, as he is a two dimensional cartoon character, but we may share a similar disregard for the thoughts of others as to what is \'normal\' or \'conventional\'.  I think he lives outside, and will probably eat any cartoon food.  Daffy Duck interacts with others, and he normally succeeds in making the other come down to his level of foolishness, where he excels and wins on his own terms.  Daffy Duck makes me feel like I should be like him, very alive and putting others through absurd situations for pure humor and novelty.

1483^NR^O^activity5^Wolves are interesting. They live in all sorts of differant habitats and climates, from Alaska to Ethiopia. They live in tight-knit groups and hunt together. They use their numbers to overwhelm larger animals such as deer, moose, etc. If they had a personality, I suppose they would be wild and rebellious. I admire the way they work together as a single functioning unit. Farmers have hunted wolves nearly to extinction in many places because they often attack livestock. This animal makes me feel independent and free, yet a part of something bigger than myself.

1485^NR^O^activity5^The wolf is the main animal I admire the most.  I think this animal is by far the coolest in the animal kingdom.  A wolf is the only animal that is just as cool by himself as he is in the pack.  He is so what fast, quite strong, and is a all round great hunter animal.    I really like the fact of how a wolf also lives in a pack, a small group of fellow wolves, together they hunt larger animals and live along side each other in a community.    I always like to think a wolf is a fairly intelligent animal, and don\'t have any really known predators (except man).  The live in wooded areas or pretty far up north.  And they make a beautiful howling noise.  They generally stay far away from civilization and a true wild animal.

1175^NR^O^activity5^This animal is furry, it\'s soft and looks nice. It\'s animal that crawls leaps and has a lot of of skill. it can jump off high places and land safely. It has a personality sometimes when it\'s sad or when it wants to be pet. It\'s sometimes comes to you when you don\'t expect it and other times it walks away from you when you want it. The animal is sometimes scared of people but it tends to not be controlled by a single person. It\'s got it\'s own character. It like to live in the company of other but almost seems that it can live on its own. It eats meat mainly and usually live in people\'s home. The animal used to be wild but has been domesticated and lives in people\'s home. It\'s sometimes fight with others and doesn\'t like others if his or her territory is breached. It interacts with some people who it finds interesting. it won\'t go to just anyone it decides on it\'s own. This animal makes me feel calm.

1392^CC^O^activity5^The person i am going to describe is Lux Lisbon from the movie the Virgin Suicides. What i admire about her is her unique personality: she is unlike all of her sisters and is very outspoken. I would say she does have a personality, especially in comparison to her family. Lux is outspoken, fun, mischevious, flirty and promiscuous. I would say we are alike because we are both different and outspoken, but i definitely do not share her thirst for sex. Lux did live a very outgoing life, until she was confined to her home, which led her to end her life. She eats typical western food, and lives in a typical suburban neighbourhood. As i said earlier, she did interact frequently with others until the end of her life. To me, Lux is the embodiment of teen spirit.

Hancock\'s personality is a little bit like mine, as in he tries to make it seem like he does not care about what people think about him, but deep down inside he is a little lonely and wants to fit in. He started off very lonely but made lots of friends towards the end of the movie. He lived on a mountain i believe. It was hard for him to interact with other people at first but he got over it. Hancock makes me feel like there is a hero is everyone.

He only likes to come around if in the mood for a quick pet. He loves yogurt and likes to sleep on the dining room table. He knows he is not suppoes to go up there, but does he care...not really. Very very soft cat. Affectionate in the mornings, especially when wanting to go outside. He is also a curious cat. If you open a drawer or a cupboard, the cat will go in to investigate. He sleeps on his back with his legs up in the air..he likes to sleep in the baby\'s old car seat that is stored in the basement as well. He is a hunter a night and does laps around the kitchen and living room wall. He is called bear because when receiving a treat he will literallu sit up on hind legs, front paws up like a bear. He is a funny, funny cat.

The octopus has two eyes and a bird beaked face. The octopus has blue bloo and what i find the most fascinating about the sea creature is that if an arm is lost it will grow back. The landscaping is within the deep sea,the octopus glides along the sandy rocky bottom of the ocean in order to catch predators.This animal is intellihgent and it makes me feel quite curious about the eight armed,blue blooded creature.

1501^NR^O^activity5^Sharks have always been animals that intrestered me. When I was younger they were my favourite and I think it is because of the Jaws movies, but I don\'t know how I developed a curiousity in them before that. I like this animal because it can be independant and defend itself when necessary. I alos find them a little frightening since they can be very vicious. I don\'t think they really have a personality, people percieve them as aggressive, but they aren\'t mean killing machines. They mind their own business and it\'s if they are bothered by something or they smell blood that they are attracted to it. They don\'t go out of their way to harm people, however it has happened, and it doesn\'t mean they are always kind, which is why there is fear. I\'d say their personailty is both similar and different to mine, because they are more solitary animals, I like to do things idependantly more often than not, but I\'m not ever violent like they can be. They mind their own business, as I said before, just I as I do a lot. They don\'t live among people, well perhaps people who live on beaches. They eat fish and seals and are likely to hunt dolphins as well, however they are not necessarily more powerful than dolphins. They live in salt-water, except for bull sharks, who are able to survive in both fresh and salt water. I\'ve never reall seen teh landscape, I guess it would be coral, and lot\'s of water. They don\'t make sounds so movements would probably be their way of interacting with otehr sharks. They don\'t interact with people, unless attacking can be considered, but that isn\'t a good kind of interaction. This animal can make me feel interested, nervous, excited and scared. From storesi I\'ve heard, movies I\'ve seen and information I\'ve read. They are really interesting animals and there are so many different kinds of sharks, my favourite are probably great whites, makos and bull sharks.

It\'s pretty sweet that they have the option of being able to cross-breed. Kind of funny too. I can\'t say I\'ve ever been in contact with a Zonkey, but I\'m sure they are just like a normal Donkey but with stripes.  It\'s personality probably isn\'t similar to mine. I\'m pretty sure they are bred in captivity and have two random parents. It lives outside, on farms. It probably only sees human interaction unless there is a breeding colony of zonkeys somewhere.   I guess they aren\'t that interesting after all

I mean I would say I am in style, I usually like like to buy things that are in style but I feel as if sometimes I don\'t fit in with my friends. Betty is an honest, kind and caring person and doesn\'t like to use or manipulate people, and neither do I. But I feel like my friends like to do that. I feel like they use me and aren\'t there for me as I am for them. I guess you could say that they are the \"Amanda and Marks\'\" of the world. I don\'t watch my diet, and neither does Betty, because I don\'t ever gain weight. Yet my friends always do, and somehow they make me feel guilty. At least Betty is someone who is real and doesn\'t care about other people\'s opinion of the way she dresses. I\'m like that in the sense that I hate \"fake\" people. I would rather hang out with the Betty\'s of the world, who know what they want and work hard for it then the those who are just selfish.

But I have always liked him. I think that I started liking him because he was affiliated with animals (bats). I have always loved animals, much more though when I was younger. I also loved how he was so mysterious and could disappear or appear without warning. This had people in awe of him. I think that I loved that he could inspire fear, hope in people, and even sexual feelings in women.  I also admire how he doesn\'t need anyone. He\'s a man unto himself. And very strong. Doesn\'t worry or get fazed by whatever he has to face, although it may be by himself. I am kind of like that. I have lots of friends, but not many close ones. I spend most of my time alone. It is lonely, but I have always been this way, and it doesn\'t really bother me. I am also great with people and sometimes love an audience. I think that that is what I like about Batman. He is fine on his own, but, as Bruce Wayne, can throw a party, although not be the life of the party, as I would be.  I also love the dark. I feel more comfortable when I can\'t be seen. I hate bright light in the morning, unless I am very well-rested.

1194^CC^O^activity5^My fictional character is Harry Potter.  I like him because he is a symbol of strength.  He is unique and he is proud of his biological foundation.  He isn\'t afraid to speak his mind and is not a passive character.  He always seems to be up for many challenges - as he faces many obsticles in his life but he never seems to break down.  He is determined and doesn\'t give up when \"the going gets rough\".  He doesn\'t let fear stand in his way.  As a character in a fictional novel, he is able to perform many role that we as humans cannot, however he doesn\'t always perform them exactly how the scripts say he should.  In sociological terms, he adlibs from the normative script.  Adlibbing is a way of \"putting your own spin on a task\".  This is done by putting an indivdual twist but the actions still match the expectations of society and do not break any sanctions.  I admire all of these things about Harry Potter!

He is extremely entertaining but otherwise does not incite many other emotions since he is often detached from life due to his dangerous job, which requires much concentration.  I admire his determination and strength, but am otherwise unbiased towards the rest of his personality.

1196^CC^O^activity5^Elizabeth Bennett from Pride and Prejudice is the character that I think is interesting.  I admire her strong convictions, always standing up for what she thinks is right and always standing up for herself. She never lets anyone push her around.  Elizabeth is the second most beautiful girl in her family, she enjoys reading and walking outside.  She does have a personality.  I feel as though our personalities are somewhat similar, although I would like to be more strong willed like she is.  Similar characteristics between the two of us include; enjoying reading, walking, outspoken, sarcastic, skeptical sometimes and gullible others.  She lives in a house with her two parents and four other sisters.  Her family eats very hearty, home-cooked food.  They live in a beautiful old english home on the country.  She is friendly towards people who she thinks is deserving of friendship, and readily points out the flaws of people who think that they are perfect.  She reacts with people often.  She makes me feel like women can be powerful and fall in love at the same time.

She is 4 years old,she was a street cat and my bother found her when she was around a year old, and gave her to me. She has quite the character...what i mean by that is she is not a friendly cat, she acts as a guard dog, attacks certain visitors, common visitors. She has very bizarre behaviours like sleeping on her back, drinking water in the bath tub. She live with no other animal and i think she would never get along with other animals in her own home, she has been exposed to other cats and some dogs in an open environment where no one felt threatened. She is an indoor cat and is some what over weight, she loves to be outside so i tie her on a leash outside. she is on an expensive diet cat food but her weight never changes as she loves human food which is not good for her!! she has to smell and investigate most food or drink that humans eat.  I absolutely love this cat, she is my first cat i have only been exposed to dogs my life and never to fond of cats until i met this one, she is unique and brings an enormous joy to my life, i adore her and could not imagine not having her, she runs to the door when i get home and a neighbor mentioned she wines in the window for ten minutes when i leave in the morning.

Their personallity is very curous in that they always have a thirst for knowledge. their personality is somewhat similar to mine in that i too have a thirst for knowledge. they live a solitary life. they eat whatever food is around, wherever they are they indulge in the local cuisine. I am not quite sure where they live as they are usually on the move looking for their next great adventure, but their home is in the united states in the 1930\'s. they interact with others by talking to them, no cellphones or email or anything like that. this person makes me feel as though i have a whole world out there to explore, so why not make the most out of life and explore it!

1116^NR^X^activity5^The animal that comes to mind is a Penguin. It\'s an odd creature, very unfamiliar to any other animal. It seems like a very independent animal that relies on itself quite often. Learning about penguins in middle school, they are very strong creatures. They tend to camp out in the blistering cold to cover their babies for days upon days without food or water. I guess it seems like a small animal is actually very strong and very intelligent. Maybe it could be related to people, maybe the big, tough individuals aren\'t actually the people that are actually big and tough.

1401^NR^O^activity5^I think my dog seras is interesting. She\'s a mixed breed but we\'re not entirely sure which breeds she actually is because we got her from an animal shelter. we speculate she is a black lab mixed with something else, possible a husky or a dane of some kind because she has a long, lean body with long legs and a small wasit but a deep chest, kind of like a sunfish. she has white on her paws and on her chest, and recently she has developed a small and faint moustache of white around her mouth. she does have a personality. seras is very different from most dogs who love spending time with their owners and playing games. seras likes to spend time alone, looking out the window for cats, squirrels or strangers. mostly cats as there is one who lives right behind our house. when we try to play ball with her she will usually \'fetch\' the ball a few times before taking it somewhere to lay down and eat it. or she will wait for you to throw the ball and then just stand there looking at you like you are some kind of idiot. its actually the first instance i have heard of where a dog has become tired of the game before the human does. but yes. as far as dogs go she does a few \'normal\' things like dig in the garden, chase cats and chew up slippers, but her demeanor and independent, superior attitude towards everyone around her seems like behaviour more suited to a cat.  like myself, we spend a lot of time alone. she doesnt spend a lot of time with other dogs and sometimes when other dogs try to play with her, she\'ll snarl or behave poorly to get them to leave her alone.  kind of like myself in the sense that i seem to be unable to make new friends since moving to ottawa. and i tend to scorn other people\'s attempts to socialize with me.  she lives in our house. she sleeps in my parents room or on the couches. she eats dog food. regular dog stuff.

1537^NR^O^activity5^The animal that I am going to describe is the lovebird. My lovebird definitely has a unique personality, which can be seen in contrast with her mate. I admire that she has a strong character, is inquisitive and enjoys the company of others. She is similar to me in the fact that she enjoys being around others, yet is very independent from her partner. She is curious about new things and is not afraid of meeting new people or picking apart objects which she is not familiar with. Personally, I think I am fairly inquisitive and independent. Also, I am quite sociable and interested in learning new things. She is a pet of mine, who is kept with her male counterpart. In the wild, I assume that she would stay with others of her kind in Africa. She is able to eat almost anything that humans eat, but she mostly likes to eat seed and millet. Typically these birds live in Africa, yet I do not know what type of landscape they thrive in as Africa is very diverse and I am not sure where in Africa lovebirds live. However, it would live in the wild. It does interact with others of its kind. Usually her mate follows her around as she is quite a leader. He tries to help her build a nest, but most of the time she indicates what she wants him to do by pushing him or giving other physical cues. If she is upset at him she chirps constantly. She is quite sociable with humans. She will approach you and land on your head very often. This makes me feel happy and noticed. When she is around I often feel glad to be in her company and I get the sense that she enjoys my company.

My cat is the only pet in our family but he gets to meet other animals when he explores outside. We live in the country so there is lots for him to discover. We feed him dry cat food but he also catches mice and birds for himself. He likes to be petted and always wants everyones attention, at least from people in the family. He\'s scared of strangers and runs away when we have guests over. I love spending time with him because he relaxes me and makes the world feel like a better place.

I admire it\'s dedication to people especially the Asian one as it is widely used to assist humans in Asian countries - logging and also for transportation.    I believe it does have a personality.  I would say it is similar to my own personality in that it is very social.  It is an animal that lives in a herd which means it likes to have company be it animal or human.    The elephant is herbivorous.  It lives in the wild in Africa and India.  However, it also resides in our Zoos and it is here that most of us can see these majestic animals.    The elephant interacts with its own kind and is very involved with the herd - they look after each other - very proective and when one of them dies they remain beside the dead one for days - they appear very, very sad at this time.    I feel that this animal is a very sentive animal, a very considerate animal - it makes me feel very good and we humans can learn a lot from it in that we should be more considerate of our fellow human beings.

She\'s also creative and artistic, living in a city she wants to be in and is surrounded by the people she wants to be surrounded by. Her personality is snarky, and witty, quick and fun-loving, but also serious and on the ball. I think in lots of ways our personalities are matched - though, hers may be a bit amplified from mine. She lives with her family and is surrounded by good friends but some parts of her life are quite solitary. Day to day life is filled with kids and spouse though. She lives in a beautiful house in Vancouver but travels to Toronto (where she\'s from) often. I\'m not sure how her fictional life makes me feel,  but it sounds like she\'s wise and I find that inspiring.

1547^NR^O^activity5^My cat is curious, constantly getting into things he shouldn\'t. He loves bread - we can\'t leave bread out on the counter or anywhere he might get to it, otherwise the bag will be shredded and the bread gnawed and chewed and crumbled. He is enthusiastic about everything - meeting new people, following birds he sees on the other side of the window and he seems to be always purring, loud, loud purrs. Unless he\'s sleeping - then he snores as loud as any human I know. And while he\'s curious and active a lot of the time, he can be very lazy too. He loves to find a sunbeam to curl up in, and has a chair that is definitely his favourite. He will run to the door when he hears my key, to great me by rubbing up against my legs. He also loves his brother, even if his brother might be less interested in him. But the two of them do spend time together, curled up together sleeping or grooming one another - that is when they\'re not chasing each other around and wrestling. My cat also likes to be underfoot a lot, we joke that he\'s trying to kill us, and maybe he is - his cute, cuddly demeanour a facade. He\'ll frequently be where you don\'t expect him, and we\'ll trip over him or step on him unintentionally. But I think this is more that he just likes to be where we are rather than done with any ulterior motive ;)

1546^CC^O^activity5^When I was little, my best friend and I were obsessed with Gordon Kormon’s books.  I always admired Bruno, who is a central character in stories about Macdonald Hall, an all-boys boarding school.  Bruno is a young boy, who is always at the center of everything.  While he causes mischief and tends to get others in trouble, he is very charismatic and always well intentioned.  He is clearly an extrovert, who does not relish spending time alone and likes leading the conversation.  He is always seeking excitement and adventure and goes on escapades to the girls’ boarding school across the street.  I don’t think my personality is very similar to Bruno’s.  I am more introverted and don’t particularly enjoy being the center of attention.  I am also not nearly as adventurous as Bruno is.  However, I am honest and sincere in a similar manner to Bruno.  Bruno’s lifestyle is quite different than my life at present.  While he boards at school and eats cafeteria food with friends, I mainly eat my meals at home with my family.  In addition, while Bruno’s school is located in the middle of the countryside in Ontario, I live in the middle of Ottawa.

1543^NR^O^activity5^I\'m writing about my pet cat. He is 11 years old and is a short haired ginger tabby.  I think he\'s intereseting because he seems more like a dog than a cat. He\'s extremely friendly and although I often find it annoying I also admire his tenacity when it comes to getting what he wants. He will come and stare at you with the pleading look that dogs give you and if that doesn\'t work he\'ll attempt to jump up on yoiur lap. Even if you block his path he\'ll still search for ways to achieve his goal. He\'s very persistent!     He also will fetch things. If you throw an item, he\'ll go to investigate it then put it in his mouth and if you call him he\'ll come to you and you can retrieve the item.  He\'s also very smart. If you hide something he\'s playing with, he\'ll try to figure out where it went. One time I took something away from him and put it on the counter. He jumped up right away and got it. I hid it in a cup but he looked around until he found it again. He only gave up after a long search for it after I put it in my pocket.     He has a very different personality than my other cat. She\'s very timid but he\'s quite aggressive and bullies her quite a bit. Doesn\'t really resemble my personality I\'m more like my other cat timid but don\'t push too far.     We feed the cats dry cat food, which they seem for the most part, satisfied with. They don\'t like people food much except for milk products.     My cat likes to go outside when it\'s warm. He likes to sunbathe. He\'s a bit of a chicken though and doesn\'t go too far from home. He catches birds and mice quite often but usually just plays with them and they often escape. I have even seen some of the mice attack him.

1565^NR^O^activity5^I am thinking of the koala that has featured in the news recently following the bushfires. In general I think of koalas as strong and gentle animals, and in particular this koala was cute, adorable and represented the Australian spirit. Koalas are slow animals, very gentle and quiet, and dont really make that much noise. The koala in the photos does have a personality, shown by how it grabbed the firefighters hand. It shows similarities between itself and other people and animals that have been saved by the volunteers since the bushfires started. Talking about me personally I would not say I am furry or slow, but I do hope I am percieved a person with gentle and strong characteristics. Koalas live solitary lives in the bush eating eucalyptus trees, away from people. As the photos show though, some can be friendly towards people. I am unsure of how it interacts with others of its kind, I have seen them growling in zoos so that shows they have a fierce streak. The koala in the photo made me feel so proud to be Australian, and that we\'re all affected as one and will all rally as one. Everyone is treated equally

When I think about her I feel a little bit jealous, because people find her so fascinating and want to be closer to her.

1601^NR^O^activity5^I used to have a dog called Fred. His real (pedigree)name was Black Sweep of Auden and he was a miniature poodle. But because he was unlike any other poodle I\'d ever met, not yappy or silly, I called him Fred (the rest of my family called him Sweep and he answered to both names).    When he was a puppy, my sister, who would then be about five years old,(I was 12) used to dress him in doll\'s clothing and push him about in a pram. My mother, seeing this, gave us both a lecture on the dignity of animals and tried to take the puppy out of the pram. He bared his teeth and snapped at her - he was thoroughly enjoying himself and didn\'t want to be removed.  He wasn\'t allowed out alone (dogs could roam free in those days but not ours) but had to be taken for a walk or run every day - by me.    I used to take him to the local recreation ground which had swings, roundabout etc., as well as a huge field and some woodland.  I\'d let Fred go and he\'d run off whilst I would enjoy the play equipment.  When he\'d finished sniffing and piddling, he\'d come to find me and if I was on the slide, he\'d run up the steps and join me. Sitting on my knee to slide down the metal hill.  One day I came home from school and Mum said, \'Sweep\'s escaped.\' (from the garden) so I had to go looking for the little pirate and the first place I looked was the \'rec\'.  It was deserted of people but there was Fred, going up the steps and sliding down the slide all by himself.     He used to love cheese and pickled onions, a favourite snack of my father\'s and would sit drooling when my father was eating. He didn\'t do this when I was eating because I\'d trained him to stay away from the table and not \'beg\' but Dad sat in his armchair.  He said, \'You dafy dog, you won\'t like onion!\' and as ajoke, offered the dog his left-over food. Fred snapped it up and looked for more.  The noise he made when eating cheese was ridiculous, it made his mouth water so much that it sounded as if he were eating lemons.  When I left home at 22, I missed Fred and later, when my father died, Mum found him something of a responsibility as they were both aging.   I couldn\'t have a dog in the apartment where I lived, so Mum had to soldier on and in fact, when Fred died, I was living overseas.  He was a tough dog and would take on any dog, big or small, if he (or I) were threatened.  I had trained him with visiable and audible commands but never needed to train him to defend us, he\'d do that instinctively.  He was once attacked by a boxer dog, very viciously but during the quite horrific fight (in which Fred was coming off worse) I attacked the boxer, pulling at its mouth and putting my fingers hard into its neck.  So we took care of one another.  I prefer dogs to cats but have never owned one since as the circumstances I\'ve lived in have made that impossible. I often think I\'d like a dog but now, at 62, it would probably outlive me and that wouldn\'t be fair.

1628^CC^O^activity5^Henry David Thoreau....Walden\'s Pond is someone I can identify with.  He left the hassle of busy life, went off to the forest on his own and stayed there for a long period of time.  He found a location to create into a hut using the hollowed out inside of a large old tree.  He took what nature provided and managed to survive.  He withstood some struggles, yet used his creative mind to gather and plant food...and provided himself with enough warmth and shelter to make it on his own.  He spent time contemplating and writing whenever he wasn\'t directly involved in organizing the necessities of life.  Extra fluff was shut out of his life so clarity could come into it.  On occasion he associated with others, but it was mostly when and how he wanted to do so.  He was one with nature as man was originally created to be.  Thoreau had inner strength, the power of endurance, and the blessing of hope as he entered the challenges of each day presented to him.  He epitomizes complete freedom and peace with the Earth.

He occasionally makes efforts to be more sociable because he thinks he should (I think)yet it seems he is happiest on his own.  There\'s always the guilt, though. He rarely cooks, if ever; he consumes food from the hospital cafeteria.  He\'s not the sort of person to kick back in a restaurant with someone special or with several friends. He isn\'t easygoing or comfortable to be around.  Most people don\'t seek him out to just bask in his presence. He\'s consulted on difficult medical cases.  The doctors who consult him are resentful that they must \"resort\" to involving House.

1581^NR^O^activity5^I chose to write about dolphins.  I have always been fascinated by dolphins as they seem to hold some sort of mystery related to intelligence.  They seem to be more intelligent than most other animals.  They always look as though they know something that humans don\'t.  They also seem to be very playful, teasing and often appear to taunt people.  It is like they are willing to give something, but just as we want to take it, they pull it away.  I think this could be said of me also.  It appears to be happiest when surrounded by other dolphins.  That, however, is not really like me.  I think I am more of a loner than a dolphin.  A dolphin lives in the ocean, surrounded by sparkling blue water, jumping and playing in the waves.  I was able to swim with dolphins once when they were feeding and it was the most amazing experiences of my life, and one that I would love to repeat in the future.  Whenever people ask me about an event that stands out in my mind, swimming with the dolphins is the one that jumps out first.

1657^NR^O^activity5^We saw some sort of bird at the beach when my partner and I went on a walk once.  They were clearly native, with native colouring.  About the size of a pigeon, they were flecked brown, dark in colour, with orange beaks and white legs.  Their legs were quite long, and their beaks quite long and thin, suggesting they were water birds.  This supposition was fairly well supported by the fact that we were watching a family of them in the water at the edge of the beach.  They had an odd behaviour.  They stood in a line angling slightly out to sea.  Every so often the bird at the front would duck around to the back of the line.  It was odd.  And they were clearly a family; as well as being the end of spring, two of the birds were clearly smaller than the other two.  It was fascinating and made us feel great that out on a walk we\'d discovered some birds we\'d never seen before and never knew existed.

1632^CC^O^activity5^For some reason the fictional character that first came to mind is Claire Huxtable from the Cosby Show in the 80\'s!!  I always admired her for being such an awesome wife and mother. She was loving, strong, fun, modern, hard-working (at home and out of the home) and put her family first, and these qualities made her beautiful inside & out. We are similar in characteristics in that I put my family first - it\'s a top priority for me. I am also a hard worker and try to have a healthy home/work/community balance.  Claire lived in a nice home with her husband and children. They were a well-to-do family with double incomes from a doctor and lawyer. They lived in a fairly modest apartment/townhouse type dwelling in an American city (I don\'t remember specifically what city). She always interacted nicely with others, often smiling and welcoming people into her home and was always willing to help if there was a need. She also seemed to instill these qualities in her children.  Claire always made me feel calm and nurtured. It was like she was EVERYONE\'s mom!! It was as if she was \"Mom of the Year\".

I would imagine he eats regular food like evryone else and he lives in Metopolis in an apartment building.

This person has a personality that is summed up with the previous attributes.  I can relate well to her because her character is very realistic, and she deals with events as they would occur in real life.  We share a similar personality in many ways, again, mostly in the attributes mentioned, but she is very outgoing and sociable which is is not so similar to me.  She lives in a busy bustling household that constantly has one drama or another happening with people coming and going and she does not get a lot of time to sit still.  She lives with her children and elderly father in a lower-class area in a state house.  The house is furnished adequately but plainly.  She is a straight talker and a bit \"rough around the edges\" but genuinely cares for others, especially her friends and family and does her best for them, going so far as to put herself last usually.  She makes me feel at ease in that I can relate to her and also brightens my mood because she is funny.  However, I do feel that I don\'t want to live her life.

1691^NR^O^activity5^The animal I have chosen was my family\'s pet pig, Boris. Boris was a large captain cooker pig which means he was more than a metre long and very large. He was pink with black spots. What I liked about Boris was that he was very intelligent and cunning. He could always figure out how to break out of his cage and on one occasion he managed to break out and sneak around the house and eat a pizza my brother had just brought home for himself. Boris very definitely had personality and he used to grunt when I scratched his back. He was very friendly and responsive. I wouldn\'t say that his personality was a whole lot like mine, but I felt we understood each other and enjoyed each other\'s company. I would describe Boris as being intelligent and this is a word I would also use to describe myself.  Pigs generally live in groups in the wild, although Boris was the only pig we had, so he was forced to be more solitary when we had him. I think his interractions with me and some of the others were so friendly and social because he was essentially more of a group animal who had been isolated, and then put among people.   Boris would eat just about anything, which I think is reasonably common for pigs. He lived in a fenced area my Dad built for him. It had a living box at one end for him to sleep and shelter from the weather in. I loved Boris very much and I was really sad when he died.

The lion at the zoo looked spoiled and selfish and worthy of that selfishness.  It is really the king and it had a few females nearby that it was ignoring. I don\'t know that I am similar to that description in any way, but I am a Leo and people often guess that about me. I\'m not into any of that astrology crap but people definitely tend to guess that i\'m a leo and like it what i act a bit like a princess. i wasn\'t raised to be one and i don\'t know why we call the lion the king of the jungle, but i guess in zoos we just see that, and maybe they act that way because it\'s what is expeted. though i guess it\'s just what we see.

Not sure about personality, they all seem to be very similar, they might have group personality, they certainly have character. I think I like them so much because they are so disimilar to me, they are very active,organised, they plan for winter etc. They are a social animal, living in groups or near other squirrels, they are commonly found amoungst people in city parks etc and are often tame enough to come and take food out of peoples hands. They eat nuts, seeds and berries, don\'t know what else. The live in trees, making nests, can\'t remember what you call their nests. their normal habitat is forests but they have become adapted to more urbal areas. Squirrels are often seen chasing each other, apart from that I\'ve not seen them interact much. Squirrels make me feel happy, they are such a silly and funny animal.

Some of the things I really admired about him was his passion for wildlife and his resolve to preserve it and how he was very much his own person through out the book. He did what he felt was right. The book was really about the swan but the boy plays a very big part in the swan\'s life and by the time the book ends the boy is a young man. The boy reminded me of a Native American yet I don\'t think he was one. He seemed in tune with nature. He lived with his parents of course, being a child and all, but seemed to be separate from them. He is respectful when interacting with adults yet says what he thinks. He is very inquisitive and very patient. He and his parents live in a house but he and his father would go spend time in a cabin in Canada, which is where he met the swan. Have no idea what he ate. Hmmm, really too tired right now to think very clearly on this. What\'s your guy\'s deal with buildings anyway?
