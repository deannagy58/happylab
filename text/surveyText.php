			"<p><br />In this study, we investigated the effects of two different writing interventions.  One focused on indoor or built environments and the other on outdoor or natural environments.  We are interested in how connected people are to their environments, both inside and outside.  In other writing studies, people generally report benefits from writing about meaningful or emotional topics.  We are interested in whether writing about different surroundings and environments has similar benefits.  It is possible that being connected and aware of our surroundings may improve happiness.  These feelings of connectedness to our surroundings and any happiness associated with them may also impact behaviour.".
			"<p><br />It is possible that being aware of and connected to our environment and surroundings may help people feel happier and be related to different behaviours.  Some researchers are finding that people who feel very connected to their outdoor environment are also concerned about environmental issues.  We are interested in how experiences in different environments are related to feelings of connectedness as well as happiness.  We are interested in testing whether improving people’s relationship with their environments is linked to behaviour as well as differences in people’s moods and happiness.  Examining how people may be connected to their surroundings is helping us to identify how these individual differences are linked to human psychological health.  The potential benefits of being connected to the outdoors for human psychological health include stress and anxiety reduction, as well as more positive emotions and general feelings of well-being.  In addition, we are interested in how connectedness to different environments may be related to attitudes and behaviour toward those environments.  This research tests whether or not writing about connectedness to different environments can help people to feel closer to their environment or surroundings and to feel happier.  The exercises you completed were about the indoor environment.
